# Overloading

Method overloading is when there are multiple methods with the same name but different type signatures.
Overloading must be done on the same class.

```java
void calculate(String);
void calculate(int);
```


# Polymorphism
```
Polymorphism allows you to write code targeting superclass objects, use that code on subclass objects, and achieve possibly different results based on the actual class of the object.
```

Allows you to do this
```java
public class Animal {
    protected String name;
    Animal(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String speak(){
        return name;
    }
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
    public Cat(String name) {
        super(name); // Must have this.
    }

    @Override // Overrides the parent class's method
    public String speak() {
        return name + ": Meow";
    }
}


public class PetShelter2 {
    private static Animal[] animals = new Animal[]{
            new Cat("Mittens"),
            new Cat("Snowball"),
            new Dog("Spot")};
    // Cat and Dog inherit from the same class -> thus keeping code simpler

    // Iterate over the animals and print their voices
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (Animal a: animals){
            System.out.println(a.speak());
        }
    }
}
```


# Abstract classes

In Java, an abstract method is declared with the keyword **abstract** and given without an implementation. If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself must be declared abstract.


- Abstract classes cannot have methods with body (unless it is static).
- As one method of the class is **abstract**, the class itself is abstract.
- **A class that cannot be instantiated** it can only be referenced, you cannot create an object out of that class

```java
public abstract class Account {
    int number;
    public abstract String speak (); // Method signature
    static void testFunc () {/* do something*/} // Legal
    void testFuncIllegal () {/*Do something*/} // Illegal
}
```

```java
// Declaration
Account a; // Acceptable
Account a = new Account(); // Will give compilation error

// Instead, we will need to declare a macro here
Account a = new Account() {
    @Override
    public String something () {
        // Do something
        return "test";
    };
};
```


# Interfaces

## Behaviour
- An interface is a behavior specification i.e. a collection of method specifications . If a class implements the interface, it means the class is able to support the behaviors specified by the said interface.

- If something is related to behaviour, we usually use an interface. eg. catClass vs Movable, do we subclass catClass from Movable? Or is it better to implement Movable interface

- Interface can extend from another interface

- Interfaces cannot be instantiatedâ€”they can only be implemented by classes

- When an instantiable class implements an interface, indicated by the keyword implements, it provides a method body for each of the methods declared in the interface.

- An interface can be used as a type

- Java allows **multiple inheritance among interfaces**. Java interface can inherit multiple other interfaces. A Java class can implement multiple interfaces (and inherit from one class).

- Interfaces can also contain constants and static methods.

- All methods in interfaces are **public**.


## Syntax and symbol
- An interface is shown similar to a class with an additional keyword ```<< interface >>``` . When a class implements an interface, it is shown similar to class inheritance except a dashed line is used instead of a solid line.


Sample:
```java
public interface AnimalClassAddon {
    int CONSTANT = 10;

    // Method signature
    void movement (String input); // Other classes (non abstract) which implements this AnimalClassAddon interface will need to specify this method

    // Static method
    static boolean isSpeedAllowed(int speed){
        return speed <= CONSTANT;
    }

}
```

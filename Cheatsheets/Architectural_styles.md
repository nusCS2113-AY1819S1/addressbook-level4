# Types of arhchitectural styles

1. **n-tier style:** In the n-tier style, higher layers make use of services provided by lower layers. Lower layers are independent of higher layers. Other names: multi-layered, layered.

2. **client-server style:** The client-server style has at least one component playing the role of a server and at least one client component accessing the services of the server. This is an architectural style used often in distributed applications.

3. **Event-driven:** Event-driven style controls the flow of the application by detecting events from event emitters and communicating those events to interested event consumers . This architectural style is often used in GUIs.

4. **Transaction processing style:** The transaction processing style divides the workload of the system down to a number of transactions which are then given to a dispatcher that controls the execution of each transaction. Task queuing, ordering, undo etc. are handled by the dispatcher.


5. **Service oriented style:** The service-oriented architecture (SOA) style builds applications by combining functionalities packaged as programmatically accessible services.

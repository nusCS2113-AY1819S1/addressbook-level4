* *Centralised Human Resource System (CHRS)* is a desktop application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* CHRS is targeted at the *Human Resource (HR) department*.
* As the HR department requires access to various information of each employee, it may be a hassle for them to obtain the required information if the information are stored in various different systems and/or databases.
* Therefore, CHRS aims to help the HR department store all relevant information to each employee within one system.
* CHRS is developed by group T16-4 from the module CS2113 in National University of Singapore (NUS).

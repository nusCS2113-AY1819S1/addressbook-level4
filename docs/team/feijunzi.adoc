== PROJECT: Something Daily

---

== Overview

Something Daily is a desktop application as a combination of to-do list and
expenditure tracker which is written in Java. The target users are NUS SoC students.
This application aims to improve students' life efficiency from helping them deal
with their numerous deadlines and plan their daily expenditures. The user interacts
with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. This project portfolio is
aimed to show my contribution to our project.

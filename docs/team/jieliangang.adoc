== Overview

This project portfolio documents my contributions to the development of the CS2113 project, as part of my team T16-2.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to manage and view employees' events* via the `invite`, `remove` and `select` commands
** What it does: allows the user to invite employees to events, remove employees from events, and view an employee's event schedule on a selected date, month or year.
** Justification: This feature facilitates managing and scheduling of events among teams of employees, and allow managers and employees to handle their own work schedules easily.
** Highlights: This feature considers whether the event an employee is invited to clashes with the employee's work schedule. The `select` feature also allows user to view the selected employee's schedule by day, month, or year.


* *Minor enhancement*:
** added the `addEvent` command, which also warns the user when the planned event clashes or coincides with other existing events at the same location and time
** improved the `editEvent` command, which warns the user when the changed time or date of the event leads to schedule conflicts with any of the event's attendees
** set up the event list panel to display the events on the UI
** set up the underlying `Event` model to facilitate other extension commands: `viewmine` and `selectEvent`

== PROJECT: WorkoutBook

---

== Overview

Are you a professional athlete who is too lazy to manually search through your workout list to find your favourite workout?
Are you an amateur who just started working out and doesn't know where to begin?
Or are you just someone who prefers to have all of your workouts in one place and organized in a tidy manner. Then WorkoutBook is the solution for you!
WorkoutBook is a desktop workout book application used for anyone who does workouts to manage their workouts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the user profile for users to use to key in their basic information and workout preference*.
** [.underline]#What it does#: This allows the WorkoutBook user to view and modify their user profile details and workout preference anytime.
** [.underline]#Justification#: This feature was implemented to allow WorkoutBook users to keep a user profile and their workout preference so that when they choose their workouts, it will show a warning if the workout they want to do does not meet their workout preference.
** [.underline]#Highlights#: This feature affects the current and recommend command that are already available. The workout preference will be used in these 2 commands to provide a warning pop up message for the current command and the recommend command can be base on the user's preference.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Modified modify command to take in the input `"any"` if the user wants no restriction on the workout preference(https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-T13-5/main/pull/210[#210]).

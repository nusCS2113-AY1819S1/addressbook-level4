== Overview

`JitHub` is a desktop meeting planning application targeted at tertiary students. Besides enabling you to view common
meeting time slots in teams, it includes various meeting tools such as the taking of minutes and a list of todo tasks.
This is done with a Command Line Interface(CLI), and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
 `JitHub` is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

JitHub is developed in my team of five throughout the course of a semester as part of module requirements in the School
of Computing, National University of Singapore.

Modules with JitHub as requirements:

* CS2101 - Effective Communication for Computing Professionals
* CS2113T - Software Engineering & Object Oriented Programming

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to view common time slots of selected persons.*
** What it does: It allows you to view the available meeting time slots based on the scheduled events of all team members
** Justification: For tertiary students like us, we identified that it is difficult to plan for group project
 meetings. Therefore, based on the needs of a tertiary student, it is great to simplify the tedious manual task of finding common
 time slots with a feature. This feature is thus a core of the product as it enables you to arrange for group meetings without
manually checking each team member's calendar.
** Highlights: To ensure that the schedule feature to view common time slots is easy to use, it required an in depth analysis of
 design alternatives. Furthermore, it implements a stringent check on date and time fields to prevent mishandling of entered information.
 To have a balance between capability and cost, a 1 day selection period is also implemented to prevent the program from taking too long to respond.
 This enhancement affects GUI to be added in future, should the common time slots be displayed in a non-text format
such as by using a calendar display visual.

//the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a Welcome Message on the calendar panel which allows people to search for photographs of an added person.
** Justification: Users needed a prompt when we conducted user tests on week 11 of the semester.

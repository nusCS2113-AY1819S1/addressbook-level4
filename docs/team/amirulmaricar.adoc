== PROJECT: Inventarie Pro

---

== Overview

Inventarie Pro is for self employed business owners who prefer to use a desktop app for managing inventory. More importantly, Inventarie Pro is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Inventarie Pro can get your inventory management tasks done faster, simpler and easier than traditional GUI apps.

** What it does: Inventarie Pro now supports multiple users on a single system by seperating user accounts and application data.
** Justification: This feature allows multiple employees to use a single system without the fear of intrusion on each other. It also prevents any unauthorized access which maintains a measure of integrity and confidentiality.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. Model and Storage components were heavily modified to support a User Database.

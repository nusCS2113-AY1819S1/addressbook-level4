== Introduction

This portfolio documents my contribution to this group project for the module https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2113T/software-engineering-object-oriented-programming[*CS2113T Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming*]
 taught in the National University of Singapore and showcases my ability to *contribute production quality software engineering work to a small/medium software project*, and the ability to *work in a team of 5*.


We are required to enhance https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[a Java sample AddressBook application] with
6kLoc(lines of code) while following software engineering principles taught in the module.

=== Product Overview
Our end product, *JitHub*, is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface[CLI (Command Line Interface)] desktop application that *helps students manage group project meetings* through cross-checking the timetables of their group mates.

*JitHub* can:

** Suggest available timeslot for group project meetings
** Import/Export contacts details between group members
** Keep track of your todos
** Suggest/Autocomplete your commands


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *import/export contacts details of different project groups*

** What it does: allows students to share contact details specific to different projects among his/her group members.

** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because only one member from the group is required to key in all the details, in contrast to requiring everyone in the team to type in the exact same details, which is tedious and inefficient.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives regarding reading and writing data. The implementation too was challenging as it required thorough understanding of all the components related to data storage in the application.
** Credits: http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/[OpenCSV]

// Excluded for 2113T
//* *Minor enhancement*: added an UI enhancement that *displays the total number of persons* in the application and the ability for the application to *backup the storage file* locally.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=jitwei98[Functional code]] -
 about 2K LoC(Lines of Code) including tests.

The `Import` component can read the Address Book data from the specified file in xml format.

[NOTE]

The import component (Import.java and ImportManager.java) is packaged under the export package.

=== ExportAll feature
==== Current Implementation

The exportall mechanism is facilitated by `CsvWriter`. Internally, a CSVWriter object from the http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/[OpenCSV]
library is instantiated to write all persons to the default file path `/data/jithub.csv`. Currently, it implements
 the following operation(s):

* `CsvWriter#write()` -- Writes the name, phone, address, and email of all persons in the current address book to
`/data/jithub.csv`, and overwrites the file if an older version is available.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#exportAddressBook()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the exportall mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user calls the exportall command with `exportall csv`.

Step 2. The LogicManager calls parseCommand with the user input.

Step 3. The AddressBookParser is called and it returns a ExportAllCommand object to LogicManager.

Step 4. The LogicManager calls execute() on the ExportAllCommand object

Step 5. The Logic component then interacts with the Model component by calling `exportAddressBook()` of the Model
interface.

Step 6. The Model interface creates a new CsvWriter object and invokes the method `write()`.

Step 7. The CsvWriter writes the data to the defined file path.

[NOTE]
The file path is defined in `outputFilepath`, and is hardcoded as `/data/jithub.csv` for now.

[NOTE]
Any existing file named as `jithub.csv` at the defined path will be overwritten.

The following sequence diagram shows how the ExportAll operation works:

// The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when `CsvWriter#write()` is called:
// TODO: show the if condition for file exists and not exists
// image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

// TODO: implementation details of write()
==== Implementation of CsvWriter#write()
Given below is the algorithm behind the write() method used in the `ExportAll` Command:

Step 1. Instantiate an OpenCSV writer.

Step 2. Write the header to the csv file.

Step 3. Declare a `List<String[]> data`.

Step 4. Loop through an
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/collections/ObservableList.html[`ObservableList<Person>`]
containing all persons in the AddressBook and push `String[] personDetails` to `data`.

    // Generates a string array for each person and stores the details
    String[] personDetails = new String[header.length];
    personDetails[INDEX_PERSON_NAME] = person.getName().toString();
    personDetails[INDEX_PERSON_PHONE] = person.getPhone().toString();
    personDetails[INDEX_PERSON_ADDRESS] = person.getAddress().toString();
    personDetails[INDEX_PERSON_EMAIL] = person.getEmail().toString();

Step 5. Write `data` to the csv file.

Step 6. Close the OpenCSV writer.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How data in the AddressBook is passed into the CsvWriter object

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `ObservableList<Person>`
** Pros: Easy to implement since `getFilteredPersonList()` is already implemented.
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
* **Alternative 2:** `versionedAddressBook`
** Pros: Looks more direct since the whole AddressBook is passed into the `CsvWriter`.
** Cons: Hard to write tests and requires more methods to process the data.

* **Solution**: The data is passed into the `CsvWriter` object through its constructor as an `ObservableList<Person>`.

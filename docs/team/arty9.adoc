== Project: Something Daily

---

This project portfolio documents my contributions to the project and our desktop application, Something Daily.

== Overview of Something Daily

Something Daily is a desktop task and expenditure tracker application that helps in the management of tasks and expenses.
The application aims to be an all-in-one package with 3 key components: To-do List, Expenditure Tracker, and Calendar.
The application is created for NUS SoC students to assist them in managing all of their academic work and spendings which will improve their busy student life.

The user mainly interacts with the application using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
The application is built upon Address Book L4, a Java application intended for NUS students in learning Software Engineering principles while using Java as the main programming language.
The project currently has over 10,000 lines of code.

Main features of Something Daily includes:

* tracks and view all added academic tasks
* provides easy-to-read deadline reminder for tasks
* records all added expenses
* provides expenditure advices based on user's expenses history
* provides daily summary on all due tasks and expenses

The project is developed by 4 NUS students and it is our goal that Something Daily can be a product that all students use on a daily basis.
We are committed in helping students like us and we plan to make the product better for years to come.

== Summary of contributions

This section highlights all of my contributions to the project and the application.

* *Major enhancement*:

1. Designed *model component for To-do List*
** What it does: It is the component that holds all to-do list related data of the application in-memory.
** Justification: This component is a core building block of the to-do list in the application.

2. Designed *storage component for To-do List*
** What it does: It is the component that reads and writes to-do list data to the hard disk.
** Justification: This component allows user's to-do list data to be stored, hence allowing the user to keep track of his/her task's progress.

3. Added *the ability to mark a task as completed/uncompleted*
** What it does: The command allows the user to mark a specific task in the to-do list as completed or uncompleted. The status is then updated accordingly in the UI of the to-do list.
** Justification: This feature is key to a functioning to-do list, where users can keep track of the status of his/her tasks.
** Highlights: This enhancement enables commands like viewing a filtered list based on task's status.

4. Added *the ability to view a filtered list of tasks*
** What it does: The command allows the user to view a list of tasks based on the task's completion status.
** Justification: This feature improves the user experience and efficiency as it helps the user in navigating through all of the tasks in the to-do list. Users can now easily separate out uncompleted tasks from completed task.

* *Minor enhancement*:

1. Updated application icon and application name to reflect accurately on our product
2. Modified and polished console messages in the application to enhance user experience
3. Wrote various test files to test different components of the application. This is to ensure the application is functional per component.

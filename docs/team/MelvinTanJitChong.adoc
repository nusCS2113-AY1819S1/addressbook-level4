== PROJECT: NUSSU-Connect

---

== Overview

The purpose of this portfolio is to document a summary of my contributions to the project. This project is a software
engineering project that aims to solve some of the common issues that NUSSU is facing.
NUSSU-Connect is an application for executive committee (exco) members of the NUS Student Union (NUSSU) to help them perform their daily tasks including managing recruitment, contacts, budgets and projects efficiently.
Other team members working on this project are Jonathan Ng Hian Leong, Sanjukta, and Soh Boon Jun.

== Summary of contributions

== Preface
This section shows the various contributions made to the project, covering aspects such as enhancement features, codes contributed and other forms of contributions.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to securely log into the application with the relevant login credentials with a specific level of access to the application features associated with the login credentials*
** What it does: allows you to login into the application with a specific role so you are only able to access role-specific features within the application.
** Justification: This feature improves the product in terms of security significantly because it prevents any random user who does not possess the correct login credentials to be able to access the application.
Due to the fact that you can only log into the application with your relevant role, it prevents any unauthorized access to other features that are only accessible for other roles.
** Highlights: This enhancement is first designed, taking into consideration the security and practicality aspects that are highly specific to NUSSU committee members, which is our target user group.
There were a few challenges, namely the addition of new commands within the enhancement itself such as deletion of accounts and changing of account passwords, and
the way account credentials are encrypted. Owing to the project time constraints, a simpler encryption algorithm, compared to traditional encryption algorithms which are stronger, is used.
The current choice of the encryption methodology of login credentials ensures the security enhancement is still feasibly robust, yet does not demand an excess of time spent working on it.
** Credits:

* *Minor enhancement*: added a create account command within the application.
** What it does: allows you to create a new account with your desired login credentials so that you can log into the application securely.
** Justification: This feature allows you to be able to create their own accounts so that you do not need to rely on the accounts of other users in order
to log into the application.
** Highlights: Similar to the major enhancement, this minor enhancement is designed in light of practical considerations of the committee members of NUSSU.
It is impractical for NUSSU, which consists of a numerous number of members, to all use the same account to log into the application. Without the account creation
enhancement, the multi-user access level feature within the login system would not be utilized at all. There should be multiple accounts with different roles that fit
different committee members with varying levels of authority within NUSSU, so that a member can create an account with an application access level relevant to his role
in NUSSU only.

== Contributions to the User Guide

== Preface
This section will touch on two commands that you can use, namely the `login` and `createaccount` command. The `login` command allows you to log into the application securely
using your own login credentials. The `createaccount` command allows you to create a new account with your own desired login credentials.

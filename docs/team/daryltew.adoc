== PROJECT: WorkoutBook

---

== Overview

Are you a professional athlete who is too lazy to manually search through your workout list to find your favourite workout? Are you an amateur who just started working out and doesnâ€™t know where to begin? Or are you just someone who prefers to have all of your workouts in one place and organized in a tidy manner. Then WorkoutBook is the solution for you! WorkoutBook is a desktop workout book application used for anyone who does workouts to manage their workouts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the memory feature which enables users to manage future, current and completed workouts*
** [.underline]#What it does#: This allows the WorkoutBook user add new workouts with an state tag of `future` being attached automatically. In order to set a workout to current, he uses the `current` command which changes the state tag to `current`. He can then finish the workout by setting the state tag to `completed` using the `complete` command. However, he can always choose to reactivate the workout by changing its state tag to `current` using the `current` command again. This flexibility enables users to fit the workouts to their changing preferences.
** [.underline]#Justification#: Users can now remember easily the relevance of each workout according to their desired criteria. `future` reminds the user that they are untouched. `current` informs the user that he is focussing
on this specific one. `completed` tells the user that he has finished this workout before. This is advantageous to the user who can now avoid forgetting whether he has already performed the workout or not.
** [.underline]#Highlights#: This feature requires two new commands - current and complete as well as modification to the pre-existing
add and edit commands to avoid affecting the state tag.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Created the seven classes of Type, Difficulty, Duration, Equipment, Instruction, Muscle and Calories for the Workout. (https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-T13-5/main/pull/3[#3])

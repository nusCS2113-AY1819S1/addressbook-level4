== PROJECT: DiveLog

== Overview

DiveLog is a command line driven desktop dive log application for divers to calculate their blood nitrogen levels prior to conducting dives.
It was built to help divers plan so as to minimise the risk of decompression sickness. The app was originally based on https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[Addressbook level 4] and
written as part of the requirements for NUS CS2113T in semester 1 of AY2018/2019.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *consistency check between dives*
** What it does: When a dive is added or edited, one must always check whether the dive is safe to attempt or not given previous diving history.
** Justification: If a user enters a dive that is too long, deep or makes subsequent dives unsafe he or she must be warned.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects both the `add` and `edit` command.

* *Minor enhancements*: Added a `set_units` command which makes the app switch between feet and meters,
integrated timezones into calculations, morphed the model.

* *Code contributed*: https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=arjo129&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-04&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[RepoSense Dashboard]

== PROJECT: Bank Address Book

---

== Overview

Bank Address Book (BankAB) is a business process management and workflow application platform, whereby its users are all the employees in a banking environment.
This platform supports the basic daily routine of each employee such as:

*  Checking working schedule
*  Applying for leave application
*  Checking in and out during working hours

The managers and administrators will have higher priority access level of BankAB such as changing the
priority level of the employee and approve or reject leave requests.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added commands and enhancements related to `Department` and `Sort Command`.
** What it does: It provides the end user to be able to perform *Department* related functions such as list and filter departments, changing an employee's department, and sorting the list based on employee's name or department.
** Justification: This feature caters to users who wants to have their employee's list sorted, the ability to list out the available departments, filtering out the employee's list based on their departments and changing an employee's department.
** Highlights: This enhancement enhances the user experience to use the commands that are related to `Department`. It required an understanding on the user profile in order to create the commands that will benefit the users. The implementation is challenging as it requires an understanding on the regular expressions in Java to allow the commands to work as how it is and to minimise bugs from happening due to incorrect regular expressions.

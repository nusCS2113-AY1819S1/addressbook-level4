== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to backup and restore user data*
** What it does: allows the user to backup current user data both online and locally. Backups can be restored by using the restore command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because our target users have the app on many desktops and this provides a convenient way to synchronise them among many devices.
** Highlights: This enhancement enables a generic class that can be easily extended by developers to support more types of online backup services in future. It requires an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
The implementation too was challenging as the backing up and restoring of online data may take a long time, existing implementation will cause the application to freeze until any backup is completed.
The current implementation exhibits a working knowledge of multithreaded applications, concurrency, event driven programming as well as GUI application design.

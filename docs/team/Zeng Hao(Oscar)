== Summary of contributions

=== `completed` *Major enhancement #1*: added the ability to set limits for multiple period of time.

** What it does: allows the user to set multiple limits for different periods of time to better manage their spend. All the limits will be stored and automaticalky check whether the limit has been exceeded. The user will be reminded if limits have been exceeded. This feature is challenging because it requires me to build a storage for limits to store limits' details and read from the storage. 
Besides that, I also need to keep limits' information updated whenever there is a change of records and generate output if any limit has been exceeded.
** Justification:This feature improves the product significantly because user will be able to make plan for their expense in advance and store all the limits. This will help user better control their spend and keep their limits updated. 
** Highlights: This enhancement is the foundation of all the features below. It affects existing commands, commands to be added in future, and storage. A new xml file will be created to store all the limits. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.

=== `completed` *Minor enhancement #1*: added the ability to delete limits.

** What it does: allows the user to delete existing limits.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user need to delete the limits that will be no longer used in the future.

== PROJECT: Bank Address Book

---

== Overview

Bank Address Book (BankAB) is a business process management and workflow application platform, whereby its users are all the employees in a banking environment.
This platform supports the basic daily routine of each employee such as:

*  Checking working schedule
*  Applying for leave application
*  Checking in and out during working hours

The managers and administrators will have higher priority access level of BankAB such as changing the
priority level of the employee and approve or reject leave requests.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the command to *check in/out to/from work* and *calculates the salary per day according to the hours worked.*
** What it does: It allows users to check in to work or check out from work and based on the time they checked in and out, their salary per day will be calculated accordingly and displayed once they checked out from work.
** Justification: This is a basic and crucial command required by a workflow management product as checking in/out to/from work is a daily process for employees to prove that they came to work and how long they have worked.
** Highlights: This enhancement provides the product the checking in/out system. The implementation was challenging as it required creating a new command from scratch.

* *Minor enhancement*:
- added `Working Rate` field to specify each employee's working rate per hour. +
- added `Checked In Time` field to specify the time that each employee's checked in. +
- added checked in/out status display on UI.

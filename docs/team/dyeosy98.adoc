== PROJECT: Inventarie PRO

---

== Overview

Inventarie PRO is a desktop inventory application intended for use by self-employed provision shop owners who wish to digitise their inventory records. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to manage distributors engaged with a provision shop*
** What it does: Allows the user to add, edit, delete and find distributors that the user would like a record of. It also allows the user to see which distributor provides what products for the shop.
** Justification: This feature is an essential part of a digitised inventory management system, given that products which a self-employed provision shop owner wants to sell must have a source of supply (a distributor).
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands which other members were concurrently working on too.

* *Minor enhancement*: I refactored some of the previous 'person' classes, methods and objects to a suitable 'product' name throughout the course of the project. I also edited some of the output messages to make them more suitable for our Inventarie PRO.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=su%20yia&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-05&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[Code Dashboard]]

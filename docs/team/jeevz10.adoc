== PROJECT: ProManage

---

== Overview

This project portfolio documents my contributions to the development of the CS2113 project, as part of my team T16-2.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *`department` attribute for each person added into ProManage*. In addition, added *the ability to `list` all people and events, with the option to view people based on their departments* via the `list` command.
** What it does: allows the user to `list people` and events. In addition, the user has the option to `list` people based on their departments.
** Justification: This feature facilitates personal information collection for users. Users can easily view all the personal information of the relevant people he/she is looking for. Similarly, the user can view all information of all events.
** Highlights: This feature considers which `department` the person is in. The user can also view the personal information of people from multiple departments.


* *Minor enhancement*:
** added a `designation` attribute to each person added into ProManage. Essentially, for v1.4, each person is either a manager or an employee.
** improved the `login` command, allowing existing users of ProManage to login with their email. This helps to increases user friendliness.

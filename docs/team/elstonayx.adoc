== PROJECT: JitHub - Schedule Management System

== Overview
This portfolio is written to document the software engineering process of CS2113T. +

For this software engineering project, I am a developer and code quality control expert, and my responsibilities are to
write improvements for the software, and to ensure that the codes are of an excellent standard before allowing major
releases of the software.

Our team, CS2113T-W12-1, consists of 5 students, Bao Lin Ruo, Chun Hong Wei, Elston Aw, Lim Jit Wei and Low Jun Wei.
We are a team based in the School of Computing, National University of Singapore.


== Project Introduction

JitHub is an application that saves your contacts and helps you schedule meetings through cross-checking the timetable of your group mates.
It is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application with GUI output so that you can have best of the both worlds.
JitHub is a Java application that you can run on any machine with Java Runtime Environment installed.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to suggest smart suggestions and corrections while typing*
** What it does: It gives the users smart suggestions when the users press `TAB`, to suggest them of the full command name and its relevant syntax.
** Justification:  a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
// saves time and helps making it convenient etc
** Highlights: write technical skills i acquired like new algorithm etc
** Credits:
*** [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/[GeeksforGeeks]] for their explanation on Trie data structure which was heavily used to implement this feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a wrong command suggestion when the user types in a wrong command and presses enter.
** What it does: When a wrong command is being typed and the `ENTER` key is pressed, the system would find a most
similar command available in the AddressBook.
** Justification: This helps the user understand what went wrong and what command could have been typed instead.
** Credits:
*** [https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/string/levenshtein-distance[trekhleb/javascript-algorithms]]
    for their explanation on Levenshtein distance (edit distance)

Through this project, I have learnt good Software Engineering practices, teamwork skills through programming, and
proper documentation for projects.

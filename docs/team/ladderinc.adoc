== Introduction and Overview
This Portfolio is a documentation of the contributions that I have made during the development of the application,
titled *NUSSU Connect*.

*NUSSU Connect* is a CLI application developed by team https://cs2113-ay1819s1-f09-1.github.io/main/AboutUs.html[F09-1] and it
 aims to cater to the needs of executive committee members of the NUS Student Union (NUSSU).

It comes with multiple features that NUSSU executive committee members will find useful. This includes budgets and expenses management,
human resource allocation, easy management of contacts lists, and all the information stored within this application will have an additional security guarantee by the multi-user access level feature.

== Summary of contributions

In this project, my main contribution is in the Search Pruning feature and the main purpose of this feature is to
ease the process of managing a large list of contacts.
Further details about my contributions will be explained in this section.

* *Major enhancement*: Search Pruning feature with `find` and `undofind` commands.

** What it does: Each subsequent execution of `find` commands allows users to search according to the
 current displayed list of contacts. `undofind` command does the opposite and reverts the last `find`
 command executed.

** Why we need this feature: NUSSU exco is an organization that will most likely be required to keep track of
a large database of important contacts. Therefore it will be time-consuming and tedious to locate specific contact information
from the database. A search pruning feature will resolve this problem as users will be able to narrow down the search space
in discrete steps so that they could retrieve the information they want in smaller and readable chunks.

** Highlights: This enhancement is mainly created from scratch with some help from documentations on how the `Predicate` class works.
This enhancement was also created with re-usability in mind and any form of filtering done with `Predicate` will be able to
utilize this feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added an enhancement to Search Pruning Feature that allows users to see a history of keywords
that they have executed previously.

** What it does: Every time a user performs a search, the command result box will display the list of keywords previously executed by the user and
it describes how the current displayed list is being filtered.

* *Minor enhancement*: Improved find command by introducing searching by tags and exclude functionality.

** What it does: Searching by tags allows users to filter the contacts according to the tagged description of each contact.
Exclude functionality allows users to remove unwanted results from their search.

== PROJECT: Centralised Human Resource System (CHRS)

---

== Overview

Centralised Human Resource System (CHRS) is an application for managing employees within the company.
The application is created to assist the Human Resource Department of the company to better manage the employees' information.
CHRS is capable of checking work schedule, creating recruitment posts, checking of expenses claims and storage of various information of each employee such as salary, department, position, etc.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added `filter` and enhanced `find` command
** What it does: The `filter` command allows user to filter out employees of a certain department, rank/position or both and the `find` command allows user to  search for a specific employee via their name or employee ID.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as the user is able to search for the required employee's details quickly.
** Highlights: This enhancement enhances the user experience as the user can now search for an employee's details without having the need to go through the whole list of employees. This feature required in-depth analysis of possible design alternatives and in-depth understanding of the HR needs when searching. The implementation of this feature was challenging as it required enhancement to existing commands and understanding of predicates.

* *Minor enhancements*:
*** Added  sorting to PersonList, ExpensesList and ScheduleList to ensure that the lists stay sorted in ascending order. (Pull request: https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-T16-4/main/pull/219[#219])
*** Enhanced `add` and `edit` commands to reject having employees with duplication in these fields: `EmployeeId` OR `Email` OR `Phone` OR `Name` and `DateOfBirth`. Should any attempt of duplication occur, the application will display the employee being duplicated and reject the command.

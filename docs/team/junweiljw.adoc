== About me

I am a team member of the JitHub developer team, in-charge of managing the documentations and implementing the Reminder feature (Major enhancement). I also attempted to work on natural language processing and Remark command (Minor enhancement)

== PROJECT: JitHub - Schedule Management Software

== Overview

JitHub is an addressbook application that allows you to quickly navigate the GUI with efficient CLI (Command Line Interface) commands. JitHub also allows you to input your timetables and compare them with yours peers on the Calendar GUI, for easier scheduling of meetings. Coded in Java, JitHub has excellent portability and can be run on any device installed with Java RunTime Environment.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added a *Reminder Command*
** What it does: The *Reminder* feature automatically *stores and displays an upcoming meeting's details* on the GUI. Multiple reminders can be set for different meetings, and can be viewed in a scrolling panel at the side of the application.
** Justification: The Reminder feature complements the user experience of JitHub significantly. By displaying meeting details on the GUI, it reduces the risk of users forgetting about their meetings, especially if their schedules are packed.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and taught me how to manage multiple classes that constitute a command, as well as how to enable my command to interact with the UI component. The greatest challenge
* *Code contributed*: [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=junweiljw&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-02&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[Reposense]]

* *Other contributions*:

** Project Management: I was in-charge of documentation and managed releases V1.1 to V1.4 on GitHub with the rest of my team

** *Feature*: I attempted to add *natural language processing to the Command Line Interface* as my initial Major Enhancement.
*** *What it does*: The *Natural Language Processing* allows users to input their commands in any order and it will still be recognised by the parser.
*** *What went wrong*: I could not fix the many edge cases that caused my tests to fail, and also I realised that `ArgMultiMap` was already doing a large part of what I attempted and hence decided to change my feature at Milestone V1.3.
*** *Highlights*: I've learnt about how to account for multiple edge cases and work my code around them so as to make it more universal.
*** *Code contributed*:
**** V1.1 [https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W12-1/main/pull/121/files[Non-functional code]]
**** V1.2 [https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W12-1/main/pull/126/files[Non-functional code]]

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Updated the GUI for Reminder and Meeting Minutes [https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W12-1/main/pull/193[#193]]
*** Wrote additional tests for existing features [https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W12-1/main/pull/193[#193]]

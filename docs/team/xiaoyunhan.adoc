== PROJECT: Something Daily

---

== Overview

`Something Daily` is a desktop application which is written in Java. We build this application based on the
Address Book (Level 4) which is used for teaching software engineering course.
We morph the Address Book into To-do list and Expenditure tracker. After that, we enhance its
ability with modifying Model, Logic, Storage and UI part and import new api from other sources.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
Generally, our product is a combination of to-do list and expenditure tracker.
It has 5 key components: to-do list, calendar, expenditure tracker, command box and result box.
The target audiences of our product are NUS SoC students and this product can help them
manage their academic tasks and spending which can increase their efficiency in management of
their student life.

Main features of `Something Daily` +

****
* Record and track user's module related tasks
* Notify user when deadline of uncompleted tasks are coming or have passed
* Record and track user's spending
* Give advice and summary based on user's expenditure history
* Simply and clear GUI to show all data stored

** Justification: This enhancement is one of key components of manging the to-do list

* *Minor enhancement #1*: add "undoable_command" class related methods to fix "undo" command on both To-do List side and Expenditure Tracker side.

* *Minor enhancement #2*: write test files in command, parser and ui parts to make sure every class related can work..

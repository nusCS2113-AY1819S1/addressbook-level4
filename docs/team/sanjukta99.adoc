=== Introduction
image::longdivider.png[align="center", width = "1000"]

This Portfolio is a documentation of the contributions that I have made for this project, titled NUSSU-Connect.

NUSSU-Connect is a resource management application targeting the members of the NUS Student Union (NUSSU). This application aims to simplify the tedious and time consuming management duties that an average club carries out. Hence the functions of our app are :
*Storing* the details about every member of the NUSSU, facilitating a comprehensive *search* feature and *financial logistics management*, integrated in a platform that supports *multi-level user access*.

NUSSU-Connect aims to be an *Efficient*, *Intuitive* and most of all *Secure* application.

The original source code of this project is the https://github.com/se-edu/[AddressBook-Level4] project created by SE-EDU initiative, and hence,
it also comes with some features from the AB4 project.

=== Summary of contributions

My main contribution to this project is the Budgeting Feature. The intended purpose of this feature is to help the NUSSU treasurers allocate budgets fairly and equitably to all the clubs under the NUSSU based on the budget calculation data collected from the clubs.

The main aim of the budgeting feature is to boost the efficiency of one aspect of financial logistics management. Hence, the feature was designed keeping in mind *ease of use* for the users, and is an attempt to *speed up* one of the more tedious management duties performed by clubs.

I will further elaborate on my contributions in the following sections.

==== Major enhancement: added the ability for club members to submit data for budget calculation and calculation of the final budgets to be allocated

** What it does: Allows the members of clubs to submit the data - the number of events that the club is planning to hold and the expected turnout of each of these events - for the calculation of their club's budget using the `budget` command. Once data from all of the clubs has been collected NUSSU treasurers can use the `calculatebudget` command to calculate and allocate a fair and equitable budget for each of the clubs based on the total available budget.

** Justification: Managing finances is one of the most important and time consuming functions of an organization. The budgeting feature implemented in NUSSU-Connect is a simple and less tedious alternative to the present budget allocation system in place in the NUSSU.
This feature helps its users save on precious time, which can now be spent on other tasks which require their attention.

** Highlights: The `calculatebudget` command was created almost entirely from scratch. The algorithm used to equitably calculate budgets is entirely my design.

==== Minor enhancement: added a feature that allows club members, NUSSU treasurers and club Presidents to view the budget allocated to a club

** What it does: Using the `viewbudget` command, club members and NUSSU treasurers can enter the name of a club and view its budget.

** Justification: This command is to be used by members of clubs to view the budget allocated to their club so that they can manage their club's expenses accordingly.
The main aim of the budgeting feature is to boost the efficiency of one aspect of

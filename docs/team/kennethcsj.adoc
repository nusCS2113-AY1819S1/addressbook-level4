== PROJECT: Book Inventory

---

== Overview

This Project Portfolio summarises my overall contributions to _BookInventory_. It is a *multi-platform* desktop application catered *primarily* for store owners to manage their book supplies - adding, deleting, requesting of books, etc.. Users interact with _BookInventory_ using *Command Line Interface (CLI)*, and has a *Graphic User Interface (GUI)* created with JavaFX. This application was developed by a *team of four* students over a semester with the original source code adapted from the Address Book (Level 4) project by SE-EDU.

== Summary of contributions

This section records my contributions for _BookInventory_.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to conveniently stock, sell and delete books* from the inventory
** What it does: to execute `stock`/`sell`/`delete` commands, one can select a book's unique ISBN using a shortcut that can scan through all available ISBN - kbd:[Tab] .
** Justification: As sales are performed *daily*, commands should be executed conveniently.
** Highlights: This enhancement not only affects existing commands, but also future commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the ability to display a list of books less than or equal to a given quantity* using the `check` command.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=kennethcsj[Functional/Test code]]

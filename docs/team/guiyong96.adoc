== PROJECT: Book Inventory

---

== Overview

*[blue]#_BookInventory_#* is a desktop application to assist bookstore `owners` in managing their books stock supply and engaging netizens who do not frequently visit book stores. This *3 in 1 application* is catered to not only the bookstore `owner`, but also the bookstore in-house *accountants* and *students*. Bookstore in-house *accountants* may assist the managers with a separate set of privileges specifically to manage profit margins and make subsequent plans. Lastly, *students* may access the app to browse the book of their choice and issue requests on *[blue]#_BookInventory_#* to the store owners to express interest.

This application is optimized for those who prefer to work with Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). In this paper, I will bring you through my thought process for each implementation as well as elaborating on how each implementation is done.

== Summary of contributions

*Major enhancement*

*  Added a command for *students* to *request* for books.
** Functionality: *Students* may request for any book by typing the command in the format given in the user guide. *Students* may request for any book, regardless of whether the book exists in the book store.
** Justification: This feature brings about convenience for *students* who can demand a book at the comfort of their homes. This is also advantageous for *bookstore owners* in gauging which books are popular and hence increase the supply of those books accordingly.
** Highlights: The implementation of an additional panel requires a separated segment from the original code. Through this process, I have learnt to be well-versed in JavaFX. The design approach and precautions taken required careful analysis and a considerably long period of time. Thorough checking and elaborate lengthy tests were also necessary to minimise undesirable bugs surfacing.

*Minor enhancements*

* Secondary UI panel now enabled strictly for store owners to view ongoing requests.
** Functionality: Owners are able to view a list of requests sent in by *students*.
** Justification: This feature is necessary for owners to view and decide whether to accept or reject a request.
** Highlights: This feature requires heavy implementation in coding as we require an additional storage and an additional model which require due amount of time to implement.

* Default page is replaced with a welcome page.

* Command Line now scans for misspelt commands and prompts the user if he or she is using the correct command.
** Credits: Algorithm adapted from https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Strings/Dice%27s_coefficient

* Predictive text enabled for users.
** Functionality: Display a message to inform user if the system detects a spelling error.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=guiyong96[Functional/Test code]]

*Other contributions*:

* Project management:
** Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4` (4 releases) on GitHub
* Miscellaneous:
** Perform refactoring for the majority of the code.
** Morphed storage portion of AB4.
** Rearranged user guide layout.
* Community:
** Addressed bugs found by peers in bug testing session.
** Several parts of the request feature implemented were adopted by others.

== Contributions to the User Guide

=== Requesting for a book : `request`

Requests to buy a book in the inventory. +
Format: `request i/ISBN13 e/EMAIL q/QUANTITY`

****
*   *Students* may indicate interest by requesting an item of a certain ISBN.
•	The email given helps *bookstore owners* confirm order with the requester. It is up to the owner's preference to decide whether he/she wishes to accept the request.
•	Possible reasons may include: Item is not a book, item not found in bookstore (Unable to find stock), quantity demanded too high.
•	Note: This app does not have an automatic email response from owner. Thus, it depends on the owner’s personal preference to decide if he/she wishes to reply.
****

Examples:

* `request i/9780321693624 e/lxh1996@gmail.com q/2` +
Request for 2 books of book ISBN 9780321693624, with email provided.

* `request i/9780205677207 e/krw1998@gmail.com q/21` +
Request for 21 books of book ISBN 9780205677207, with email provided.

[NOTE]
====
* ISBN input must be valid. Please refer to an online website to search for the book ISBN.
* It is necessary for you to provide an email so that the owner can contact you.
* Quantity input is capped at 999. You are unable to request beyond this amount.
====

=== Deleting a request : `deleterequest`

Deletes the specified request from the request list. Strictly for *bookstore owners*. +
Format: `deleterequest INDEX`

Examples:

* `deleterequest 2` +
Deletes the 2nd request in the displayed request list.

* `deleterequest 27` +
Deletes the 27th request in the displayed request list.

=== Toggle request panel : `togglerequests`

Toggle the request panel.  Strictly for *bookstore owners*. +
Format: `togglerequests`

****
*   *Bookstore owners* may choose to use this command when they find it a hassle to handle too many UI panels.
•	When toggled off, requests will be hidden and request panel can be minimized.
•	When toggled back on, request panel is readjusted and re-displayed.

// tag::Request[]
=== Request feature
==== Current implementation
The `Request` command utilises both the `RequestModel` and `Logic` component to fulfil its function.
This is accessible for all users.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Request command is implemented in a different category
As mentioned above, `Request` is called in `RequestModel` and `RequestStorage`.
A request object consists of three objects, `Isbn`, `Email`, and `Quantity`.

===== RequestModel component

.Structure of the `RequestModel` Component
image::RequestModelClassDiagram.jpg[width="800"]

The implementation is similar to 2.4. Model component.
Note that `XmlAdaptedTag` class is removed as request has no tags.

===== RequestStorage component

.Structure of the `RequestStorage` Component
image::RequestStorageClassDiagram.jpg[width="800"]

Likewise, this implementation is similar to 2.5. Storage Component.

===== Aspect: How Request command is implemented

.Structure of `Request` (High Level Sequence Diagram)
image::HighLevelRequestSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

* **Similar to `Add` Command**
** After request command is called by the user, it gets parsed through a `RequestListParser`.
** The UI also prompts to `EventCenter` and shows that the `RequestList` has changed.
** `Request` object is created and added to the model.
** The storage then receives the request and returns message to model, which is then transferred to the UI.
** This notifies the user that the request is successfully submitted.

* **Similar to `Delete` Command**
** The bookstore owner may decide whether to accept or reject a request offer.
** After deciding, he or she can type `deleterequest` to remove `Request` from the `RequestList`.

===== Aspect: How ToggleRequests command functions

.Sequence Diagram of the `ToggleRequests` Component
image::ToggleRequestSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

** When the user types `togglerequests`, a `RequestPanelChangedEvent` exception is raised.
** A function in the UI page, `MainWindow`, handles this event by toggling the display.
** A message will then be sent to the user, indicating that the request panel is toggled.

// end::Request[]

=== Command Prediction

==== Rationale
To maximize user friendliness, we have implemented predictive text which will appear
familiar for phone users. *[yellow]#_BookInventory_#* users may inadvertently misspell command words,
e.g. lis (Expected command: list). This will now prompt a GUI log stating, "Did you mean,
list?" To achieve this, we have utilized the Dice Coefficient.

==== Current Implementation

.Logic Sequence Diagram (Command "Togglereq" called)
image::CommandPredictionSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Here is a step-by-step walk-through on how this algorithm works.

Step 1: When the user types "togglereq" in the command box and hits enter, the command is accepted by the UI
and passed to the `LogicManager`.

Step 2: It first gets the `previousCommand` keyed in by the user. This is necessary
as the commands undo/redo are only accepted in `RequestList` if the previous command keyed in
belongs to `RequestList`.

Step 3: `parseInput` is then called, which returns true as `DifferentiatingParser` detects that the command should
 belong to `RequestListParser`. `LogicManager` then calls `parseCommandRequest`.

Step 4: `RequestListParser` calls `performSimilarityCheck` in `SimilarityParser`. Dice Coefficient detects that the
command is similar to the command `togglerequests`, and return it in the form of a String, in `predictedCommand`.

Step 5: `ParseException` is eventually thrown in `RequestListParser`, signalling to the user that
a spelling error is detected.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How does Dice Coefficient works?

Dice's coefficient measures the similarity between two sets. In *[yellow]#_BookInventory_#*, we use it to help measure how
similar two strings are in terms of the number of common bigrams (A bigram is a pair of adjacent
letters in the string).The Coefficient result of 1 indicates identical vectors (completely equal strings) as
where a 0 equals orthogonal vectors (completely unequal strings).

Formula: Dice's coefficient = (2 * Common Terms) / (Number of terms in String1 + Number of terms in String2)

===== Aspect: How well does this algorithm predicts?

Our current implementation sets Dice's Coefficient to 0.5. For some scenarios, we have implemented
an adjusted value of 0.7. Through our testing, this appears fine for most spelling errors.
However, it will not predict too ridiculous errors because we do not wish to face a scenario where
the suggestion offers another command word which is unintended by the user.

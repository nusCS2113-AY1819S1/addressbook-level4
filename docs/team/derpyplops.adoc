== PROJECT: NUSSU Connect


== Introduction

This Portfolio is a documentation of the contributions that I have made for this project, titled NUSSU Connect.

NUSSU Connect is a CLI application mainly targeted towards executive committee (exco) members of the NUS Student Union (NUSSU).
Being representatives of the NUS student body, the exco members has a part in many projects and initiatives.
This application therefore aims to help them perform some of these miscellaneous tasks that often comes from these projects much more easily,
and to deliver value by requiring less manhours from each NUSSU members to perform a given task, saving on costs.

The application was developed on Windows and was tested on Windows and macOS. It accepts mainly text-based input,
which aims to offer a faster and more responsive experience compared to
a graphical user interface (GUI), for experienced users.

Additionally, it comes with several features. This includes budgets/expenses management, human resource allocation and managing of important contacts.
The original source code of this project is the https://github.com/se-edu/[AddressBook-Level4] project created by SE-EDU initiative, and hence,
it also comes with some features from the AB4 project.

== Summary of contributions

In this project, my main contribution is the Add Skill Command, which augments the main Person class with two additional
properties: the Skill and SkillLevel. This aids in Human Resource Management and committee recruitment as
the best people for a particular role can be quickly identified and selected. I also developed the Sort Command.

* *Major enhancement*: added the AddSkillLevelCommand (keyword: "asl")

** What it does: Data integrity is important, but these days, users expect their data to be highly available.
The `sort` command

** Justification: There is a need to track people and their skills, often being their most valuable
assets, are especially critical to track. A project manager may now easily find any new people that
the organization tracks, and given adequete talent pool, will be able to identify what they want.

** Highlights: In order to implement this, all aspects of the application were touched on,
namely UI, Storage, Logic and Model.


* *Major enhancement*: added the SortCommand (keyword: "sort")

** What it does: Sorts a list of people by some criteria.

** Justification: Data integrity is useful, but nowadays people expect data to be
have high availability (in a quick and accessible format). A project manager,
with the sort command, is now able to, at a glance, review potential candidates for
the role.

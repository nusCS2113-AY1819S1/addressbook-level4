By: `CS2113-AY1819S1-W12-1`      Since: `Aug 2018`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
// TODO: modify architecture diagram to display current implementations
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  The userInput is processed by a Natural Language Processor and Suggestion component and the relevant data is parsed into its corresponding classes
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

// tag::export[]
[[Design-Export]]
=== Export component

.Structure of the Export Component
image::ExportClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/export/Export.java[`Export.java`]

The `Export` component can save the filtered persons to the specified file in xml format.
// end::export[]

// tag::import[]
[[Design-Import]]
=== Import component

.Structure of the Import Component
image::ImportClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/export/Import.java[`Import.java`]

The `Import` component can read the Address Book data from the specified file in xml format.

[NOTE]
====
The import component (Import.java and ImportManager.java) is packaged under the export package.
====
// end::import[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::exportall[]
[[exportall]]
=== ExportAll feature
==== Current Implementation

The exportall mechanism is facilitated by `CsvWriter`. Internally, a CSVWriter object from the http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/[OpenCSV]
library is instantiated to write all persons to the default file path `/data/jithub.csv`. Currently, it implements
 the following operation(s):

* `CsvWriter#write()` -- Writes the name, phone, address, and email of all persons in the current address book to
`/data/jithub.csv`, and overwrites the file if an older version is available.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#exportAddressBook()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the exportall mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user calls the exportall command with `exportall csv`.

Step 2. The LogicManager calls parseCommand with the user input.

Step 3. The AddressBookParser is called and it returns a ExportAllCommand object to LogicManager.

Step 4. The LogicManager calls execute() on the ExportAllCommand object

Step 5. The Logic component then interacts with the Model component by calling `exportAddressBook()` of the Model
interface.

Step 6. The Model interface creates a new CsvWriter object and invokes the method `write()`.

Step 7. The CsvWriter writes the data to the defined file path.

[NOTE]
The file path is defined in `outputFilepath`, and is hardcoded as `/data/jithub.csv` for now.

[NOTE]
Any existing file named as `jithub.csv` at the defined path will be overwritten.

The following sequence diagram shows how the ExportAll operation works:

image::ExportAllSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

// The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when `CsvWriter#write()` is called:
// TODO: show the if condition for file exists and not exists
// image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

// TODO: implementation details of write()
==== Implementation of CsvWriter#write()
Given below is the algorithm behind the write() method used in the `ExportAll` Command:

Step 1. Instantiate an OpenCSV writer.

Step 2. Write the header to the csv file.

Step 3. Declare a `List<String[]> data`.

Step 4. Loop through an
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/collections/ObservableList.html[`ObservableList<Person>`]
containing all persons in the AddressBook and push `String[] personDetails` to `data`.

    // Generates a string array for each person and stores the details
    String[] personDetails = new String[header.length];
    personDetails[INDEX_PERSON_NAME] = person.getName().toString();
    personDetails[INDEX_PERSON_PHONE] = person.getPhone().toString();
    personDetails[INDEX_PERSON_ADDRESS] = person.getAddress().toString();
    personDetails[INDEX_PERSON_EMAIL] = person.getEmail().toString();

Step 5. Write `data` to the csv file.

Step 6. Close the OpenCSV writer.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How data in the AddressBook is passed into the CsvWriter object

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `ObservableList<Person>`
** Pros: Easy to implement since `getFilteredPersonList()` is already implemented.
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
* **Alternative 2:** `versionedAddressBook`
** Pros: Looks more direct since the whole AddressBook is passed into the `CsvWriter`.
** Cons: Hard to write tests and requires more methods to process the data.

* **Solution**: The data is passed into the `CsvWriter` object through its constructor as an `ObservableList<Person>`.
// end::exportall[]

// tag::todo[]
=== Todo Feature
This feature allows users to add a to-do task.

==== Current Implementation
The todo mechanism is facilitated by the `TodoComand` from the `Logic` component. A `Todo` object is instantiated to add a to-do task and each `Todo` object consists of  a `Title` and `Content` object.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the todo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user calls the todo command with its relevant parameters. e.g `todo tt/Buy tomato c/Buy tomato at NTUC otw back to school`.

Step 2. The LogicManager calls parseCommand with the user input.

Step 3. The AddressBookParser is called and it returns a TodoCommand object to the LogicManager.

Step 4. The LogicManager will call execute() on the TodoCommand object. If the to-do task of the same title and content is found, it would return a string of message `MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_TODO`.

Step 5. The Logic component then interacts with the Model component which calls `addTodo(todo)` to add the to-do task

Step 6. The command result would then return the message `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` in a string and the to-do task added will be displayed on the to-do list panel.

The following diagram illustrates the Todo class:

image::TodoClassDiagram.png[width="200"]

The following diagram illustrates how the Todo operation works:

image::TodoSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Checking for duplications of to-do tasks
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `isSameTodo`
** Pros: Easy to implement and write the test as it checks for both the title and the content of a to-do task
** Cons: This implementation may store too many similiar to-do tasks.
// end::todo[]

// tag::finishTodo[]
=== FinishTodo Feature
This feature allows users to complete the to-do task he/she has created.

==== Current Implementation
The finishTodo mechanism is facilitated by the `FinishTodoCommand` from the `Logic` component. Upon pressing executing the `finishTodo` command, the to-do task chosen by users will be removed from the `addressbook.xml` in the data folder.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the finishTodo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user calls the finishTodo command with the to-do task's displayed index. e.g `finishTodo 1`.

Step 2. The LogicManager calls parseCommand with the user input.

Step 3. The AddressBookParser is called and it returns a FinishTodoCommand object to the LogicManager.

Step 4. The LogicManager will call execute() on the FinishTodoCommand object. If no to-do of the corresponding index is found, it would return a string of message `MESSAGE_INVALID_TODO_DISPLAYED_INDEX`.

Step 5. The Logic component then interacts with the AddressBook component to execute `removeTodo(target)` to remove the to-do task.

Step 6. The command result would then return the message `MESSAGE_FINISH_TODO_SUCCESS` in a string.

The following diagram illustrates how the FinishTodo operation works:

image::FinishTodoSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How finishTodo feature handles the to-do task
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `removeTodo`
** Pros: Easy to implement and write the test as it simply removes the to-do entry from the storage.
** Cons: Users cannot view the previously completed to-do tasks.

* **Alternative 2:** `markTodoAsCompleted`
** Pros: Better user experience as users simply mark it as completed and the completed to-do tasks will thus be displayed on another panel.
** Cons: More tedious to write the tests.
// end::finishTodo[]

// tag::suggestion[]
=== Suggestions Feature
The suggestions feature gives users helpful suggestions on what command to type, and corrections for commands when incorrect
commands are being entered.

==== Current Implementation
There are two instances when suggestions are given.

Firstly, when a user completes entering a command (after pressing `ENTER` key), if the command typed is invalid, such as
commands being misspelt, the system will suggest a similar command based on the edit distance (which will be explained later).

The second instance would be when the user presses tab while typing the command halfway. The system will suggest commands
based on the current prefix string. If only a single command is available, the command would be completed for the user,
and the system would show the parameters required for that command.

===== Wrong Command Suggestion
Given below is an example usage of how the WrongCommandSuggestion behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user would type in a misspelt command string into the Command Box pane.

Step 2: The command would be parsed into the AddressBookParser class. Since no commands match the word exactly, it would
fall into the default case.

Step 3: The default case would extract out only the command portion of the user input, and input it into the
WrongCommandSuggestion class.

Step 4: WrongCommandSuggestion would then instantiate the StringSimilarity class to find the nearest match of a word.

Step 5: editDistance in StringSimliarity class would be called to find out the edit distance between two words. These two
words would be the wrong command the user has input, and the list of available commands in the whole application.

Step 6: WrongCommandSuggestion would then compare if the edit distance of the current command is shorter than the current
shortest edit distance command (which is initialised to 5 edits). If it is shorter, it would then suggest the current command.

Step 7: WrongCommandSuggestion would then return the suggestion in a string, which would then be inputted into the CommandException,
to be thrown to the LogicManager class.

The following sequence diagram shows an example of how the WrongCommandSuggestion operation works with
misspelt command "histary" (closest command is `history`):

image::WrongCommandSuggestionSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

//TODO: explain implementation of Levenshtein Distance

===== Input Command Suggestion
Given below is an example of how the InputCommandSuggestion behaves at each step.

Step 1: Upon instantiation of CommandBox during the program instantiation phase, CommandBox will create an instance of
InputCommandSuggestion, which will create a Trie containing all the commands available in the application.

Step 2: When the user presses `TAB` after entering a command, CommandBox will call method `handleTabPressed()` to fetch
the current input that the user has typed.

Step 3: `handleTabPressed()` method will then call the `getSuggestedCommands()` method in InputCommandSuggestion, while
inputting the user's input into the parameters.

Step 4: The InputCommandSuggestion would then find available commands using the Trie class and determine whether there
are any other possible combinations of commands with the current string of words.

Step 5: The Trie class would then return a list of commands available, which would then pass back to CommandBox.

Step 6a: If there is only one command available, CommandBox would auto-complete the current input with the valid command,
then request for the Command Parameters through the InputCommandSuggestion class. It would then pass the string to be
posted on EventsCenter, so that the Command Parameters would be displayed on the results panel.

Step 6b: If there are multiple commands available, CommandBox will pass all the possible commands to EventsCenter, to
output all possible commands available with the current string.

The following sequence diagram shows an example of how the InputCommandSuggestion class works:

image::InputCommandSuggestionSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

==== Design Considerations

For the WrongCommandSuggestion implementation, there were multiple design considerations while implementing the feature.

* **Alternative 1:** Compare the input command and the actual command character by character and see
which command has the most matches.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Not as accurate or reliable in terms of giving a correct match of command.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use a string matching algorithm to implement the matching and difference
calculation between the command and the user input.
** Pros: Accurate prediction or suggestions from actual commands.
** Cons: Difficult to implement, and might require more processing overhead.

For the InputCommandSuggestion implementation, there were multiple design considerations while implementing the feature.

* **Alternative 1:** While the user types, command suggestions would be given continuously with regards
to the user's input.
** Pros: Makes it more convenient for typing in commands as there is immediate response of the correctness of the command.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage, complicated to implement, and requires a lot of work on
the UI for the application.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** When the user requires corrections to the command or requires feedback, press `TAB`
key to receive suggestions given by the system.
** Pros: Less overhead to the system as the system does not have to constantly run the algorithm to check for valid and
available commands.
** Cons: Feedback is less responsive, and requires additional keys for users to press.

//end::suggestion[]

// tag::schedule[]
=== Schedule Feature
==== Current implementation
The schedule mechanism is facilitated by `Person`. It adds a schedule data set into a `Person` that was previously created
to keep track of events and allow for searching of common available time slots later on.

Given below is an example of a usage scenario and how the schedule mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user calls the schedule command with `schedule index date startTime endTime eventName`.

Step 2. The LogicManager calls parseCommand with the user input.

Step 3. The AddressBookParser is called and it returns a ScheduleCommand object to LogicManager.

Step 4. The LogicManager calls execute() on the ScheduleCommand object.

Step 5. The ScheduleCommand object creates a person object for model.

Step 6. The Logic component then interacts with the Model component by calling UpdatePerson("target, editedPersonWithSchedule")

Step 7. The Model component updates the address book.

.Schedule sequence diagram
image::ScheduleSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

==== Match schedule

Given below is the algorithm behind the matchSchedule command.

Step 1. The user calls the matchSchedule command with `matchSchedule date startTime endTime index...`

Step 2. The LogicManager calls parseCommand with the user input.

Step 3. The AddressBookParser is called and it returns a MatchScheduleCommand object to LogicManager.

Step 4. The LogicManager calls execute on the MatchScheduleCommand object.

Step 5. The MatchScheduleCommand object finds common time slots in the date and time range given by startTime and endTime
by generating an array, and updates the UI part of address book.

    // Generates an int array (startEndTimeBlock) of size 1440 which stores whether each minute of the day is busy
    for (int i = 0; i < this.startTimeList.size(); i++) {
                for (int j = this.startTimeList.get(i).timeToMinutesInDay();
                     j <= this.endTimeList.get(i).timeToMinutesInDay(); j++) {
                    this.startEndTimeBlock[j] = 1;
           }
    }

==== Design considerations
Aspect: How schedule is stored
* Alternative 1 ( Current choice ): Schedule is stored with the Person

** Pros: Easy to implement, easy to display from UI
** Cons: /TO BE DONE/ Test case constraints

* Alternative 2: Schedule is stored on it's own, with a reference tag from the Person to retrieve and display it.
** Pros: Separate from the person to improve SOC.
** Cons: Expensive and difficult to implement.


Aspect: How match schedule executes

* Alternative 1 ( Current choice ): Matches schedule only for 1 day

** Pros: Easy to implement, less expensive in memory usage
** Cons: Unable to check across different dates

* Alternative 2: Matches schedule across entire span

** Pros: Allows for a more friendly usage of matching schedules
** Cons: Very expensive in memory usage

// tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar Feature
This feature allows users to complete the to-do task he/she has created.

==== Current Implementation
The calendar feature resides in the `UI` component to render the view of a monthly calendar at the current locale time.
The calendar feature itself is at v0.1 since it only displays the dates of the month.

The following diagram illustrates how the Calendar view is rendered:

image::CalendarSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Implementation of the calendar
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `JavaFx Scence`
** Pros: Gives a responsible layout on the calendar panel and allows the user to view the calendar with different screen size.
** Cons: Most of the code is hardcoded and thus less maintainable.

* **Alternative 2:** `CalendarFx`
** Pros: Cleaner code since it will be imported from external libraries and better UI. It could potentially speed up the development process.
** Cons: CalendarFx so far has version 8, 10 and 11. It does not support Travis which complies most of the packages using jdk9, which potentially hinder the debugging process done by Travis.
// end::calendar[]

// tag::displayScheduleOnCalendar[]
=== Schedule Display Calendar Selected Person
This feature allows the calendar of a person to be displayed upon being selected.
==== Current Implementation
This makes use of the calendar feature, which activates the rendering of the calendar upon an event of a person being selected.

Upon the selection of a person, the calendar will overwrite the welcome message view, showing the calendar of the current month.

*It is unable to show the schedules added into the person.*

=== [Proposed] Schedule Display Calendar Selected Person [V2.0]

When a person is selected, the person's schedule should be displayed on the calendar panel.

The string of common time slots printed on the resultCommandWindow should be displayed on the calendar panel, under the
correct date.

.Calendar UI Component
image::FutureCalendarUI.png[width="380"]

// end::displayScheduleOnCalendar[]

// tag::reminder[]
=== Reminder Feature
Add a reminder to notify users of an upcoming meeting.

==== Current Implementation

The reminder mechanism is facilitated by the `ReminderCommand`, which extends `Command`, from the `Logic` component. A `Reminder` object is instantiated and each `Reminder` object consists of `Title`, `Date`, `Time` and `Agenda` objects.

The following diagram illustrates the Reminder class:

image::ReminderClassDiagram.png[width="200"]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the reminder mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. A student launches the application for the first time and types in a valid reminder command into the CommandBox Pane.

Step 2. The command will be parsed into the `AddressBookParser` class.

Step 3. AddressBookParser recognises the command word `reminder` and parses the remaining arguments into `ReminderCommandParser`.

Step 4. `ReminderCommandParser` checks for the validity of the `title`, `date`, `time` and `agenda` parameters.

Step 5. If the parameters are valid, `addReminder()` in the `Model` component updates the `VersionedAddressBook` with the new `Reminder`.

Step 6. This exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Reminder>` that the `ReminderListPane` in the `UI` is bound to, automatically updating itself upon the addition of the new `Reminder`.

The following diagram illustrates how the `ReminderCommand` operation interactions with the `Logic` and `Model` components:

image::ReminderSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Checking for duplications of reminders

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `isSameReminder`
** Pros: Easy to implement and write the test as it checks for all the parameters of a reminder.
** Cons: This implementation may store too many similiar reminders.

===== Aspect: Too many UI Windows

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implementing a `VBox` to split the `Todo` and `Reminder`
** Pros: This makes the 2 panes take up only half the size of normal panes, reducing the clutter on the screen. Since there isn't a need for too many `Todo` and `Reminder` to be displayed concurrently, a small pane is useable. Furthermore, the individual panes are also scrollable and resizeable.
** Cons: This results in a smaller pane for each component, which may cause them to be overlooked.

* **Alternative 2:** A command to switch between the `Todo` and `Reminder` panes
** Pros: More space is catered towards both panes, allowing for the display of more information.
** Cons: Concurrent viewing of `Todo` and `Reminder` will not be possible.
// end::reminder[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

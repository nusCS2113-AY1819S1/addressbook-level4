[big]#*Welcome to RecruitBook!*#

RecruitBook is an offline desktop application that allows you to manage job candidates and job offers
throughout the process of recruiting. Designed specifically to ease the recruitment process, you can use RecruitBook
to add, edit, find, filter, shortlist, email and delete candidates, as well as job offers, to help you efficiently link
potential candidates to the job offer that is best suited for them. Hence, you can organise and sift out your desired
information with just a few clicks due to the meticulous data handling in RecruitBook.

RecruitBook is written in Java, and you can interact with it using Command-Line Interface(CLI), as well as Graphical User Interface(GUI).
Its GUI is created with JavaFX.

This guide provides information that will not only help you get started as a RecruitBook contributor, but also get
a better understanding of data handling and code implementation if you are interested in coding.

We welcome feedback and queries, and you can contact us at cs2113.f09.4@gmail.com.


== Getting Started

Follow the simple list below to get RecruitBook up and running with Java.

=== Prerequisites

If you have Java 9 and IntelliJ set up, you may skip to <<Setting up the project in your computer, 1.2>>.

. Install *JDK `9`* or later
+
You may download it https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase9-3934878.html[here].
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. Install *IntelliJ* IDE
+
You may download it https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows[here].
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-F09-4/main[this] repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run `seedu.recruit.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.


== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.


[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recruit/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component in Figure 2 defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ in Figure 3 shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `CandidateBookChangedEvent` when the Recruit Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram in Figure 4 shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recruit/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

As illustrated in Figure 5, the UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CandidateDetailsPanel`, `CompanyJobDetailsPanel`, `ShortlistPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

There are 4 placeholders inside `MainWindow` that fills the screen along with the menu bar.

|============
|Placeholder | Parts of `MainWindow`
|commandBoxPlaceholder | `CommandBox`
| resultDisplayPlaceholder | `ResultDisplay`
| panelViewPlaceholder | `CandidateDetailsPanel` `CompanyJobDetailsPanel` `ShortlistPanel`
| statusbarPlaceholder | `StatusBarFooter`
|============

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recruit/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recruit/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

As illustrated in Figure 6,

.  `Logic` uses the `RecruitBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a candidate) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below in Figure 7 is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recruit/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Recruit Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Candidate>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Recruit Book`, which `Candidate` can reference. This would allow `Recruit Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Candidate` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recruit/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Recruit Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.recruit.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::add/delete[]
=== Add/Delete Feature
==== Current Implementation
===== Candidates
The add/delete mechanism of candidates is facilitated in `UniqueCandidateList` which stores the added candidates internally as an `internalList` which is a list of Candidate objects.

It implements `Iterable<Candidate>`, where it overrides the `Iterator`, `equals` and `hashCode` of the `Iterable` interface.
Additionally, it implements the following operations to support adding/deletion of candidates:

* `UniqueCandidateList#contains(Candidate candidate)` — Checks whether a candidate exists inside `internalList` using `Candidate#isSameCandidate` to define equality.
* `UniqueCandidateList#add(Candidate candidate)` — Adds a unique candidate to `internalList`. Checks for uniqueness using `UniqueCandidateList#contains(Candidate candidate)`.
* `UniqueCandidateList#remove(Candidate candidate)` — Removes the equivalent candidate from `internalList`.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as Model#addCandidate(Candidate) and Model#deleteCandidate(Candidate candidate) respectively.

===== Companies
The add/delete mechanism of companies is facilitated in `UniqueCompanyList` which stores the added companies internally as an `internalList` which is a list of Company objects.

It implements `Iterable<Company>`, where it overrides the `Iterator`, `equals` and `hashCode` of the `Iterable` interface.
Additionally, it implements the following operations to support adding/deletion of companies:

* `UniqueCompanyList#contains(Company company)` — Checks whether a company exists inside `internalList` using `Company#isSameCompany` to define equality.
* `UniqueCompanyList#add(Company company)` — Adds a unique company to `internalList`. Checks for uniqueness using `UniqueCompanyList#contains(Company company)`.
* `UniqueCompanyList#remove(Company company)` — Removes the equivalent company from `internalList`.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as Model#addCompany(Company) and Model#deleteCompany(Company company) respectively.

===== Job Offers
The add/delete mechanism of job offer is facilitated in `UniqueJobList` which stores the added job offer internally as an `internalList` which is a list of JobOffer objects.

It implements `Iterable<JobOffer>`, where it overrides the `Iterator`, `equals` and `hashCode` of the `Iterable` interface.
Additionally, it implements the following operations to support adding/deletion of job offer:

* `UniqueJobList#contains(JobOffer jobOffer)` — Checks whether a job offer exists inside `internalList` using `JobOffer#isSameJobOffer` to define equality.
* `UniqueJobList#add(JobOffer jobOffer)` — Adds a unique job offer to `internalList`. Checks for uniqueness using `UniqueJobOfferList#contains(JobOffer jobOffer)`.
* `UniqueJobList#remove(JobOffer jobOffer)` — Removes the equivalent job offer from `internalList`.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as Model#addJobOffer(JobOffer) and Model#deleteJobOffer(JobOffer jobOffer) respectively.

[NOTE]
All addition/deletion of the 3 entities (Candidates, Companies, Job Offers) follow the same mechanism.

Given below is an example usage scenario for adding/deleting of these entities and how the adding/deleting mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

.. `UniqueCandidateList` will be initialised with the list of saved candidates in RecruitBook
.. `UniqueCompanyList` will be initialised with the list of saved companies in RecruitBook
.. `UniqueJobList` will be initialised with the list of saved job offers.

Step 2. The user executes ...

        .. `addc n/John Doe ...` to add a new candidate. `AddCandidateCommand` calls `Model#hasCandidate(Candidate candidate)` to check if a duplicate entry exists. Then `Model#addCandidate(Candidate candidate)` and adds the candidate to the CandidateBook.
        .. `addC c/McDonalds ...` to add a new company. `AddCompanyCommand` calls `Model#hasCompany(Company company)` to check if a duplicate entry exists. Then `Model#addCompany(Company company)` and adds the company to the CompanyBook.
        .. `addj c/McDonalds ...` to add a new job offer. `AddJobDetailsCommand` calls `Model#hasJobOffer(JobOffer jobOffer)` to check if a duplicate entry exists. Then `Model#addJobOffer(JobOffer jobOffer)` and adds the job offer to the CompanyBook.

Step 3. The user executes ...

        .. `deletec 1,3-4` to delete multiple candidates. `DeleteCandidateCommand` calls `Model#removeCandidate(Candidate candidate)` for the candidates listed at index 1, and 4.
        .. `deleteC 1,3-4` to delete multiple companies. `DeleteCompanyCommand` calls `Model#removeCompany(Company company)` for the companies listed at index 1, and 4.
        .. `deletej 1,3-4` to delete multiple job offers. `DeleteJobOfferCommand` calls `Model#deleteJobOffer(JobOffer jobOffer)` for the job offers listed at index 1, and 4.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How add/delete feature executes

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the add/delete feature

// end::add/delete[]

// tag::edit[]
=== Edit Feature
==== Current Implementation
===== Candidates
The edit mechanism for candidates is facilitated by `EditPersonDescriptor` in `EditCandidateCommand` which creates a new Candidate object with edited attributes
and `UniqueCandidateList` which stores candidates internally as an `internalList` which is a list of Candidate objects.
Additionally, it implements the following operations to support the editing of candidates.

* `UniqueCandidateList#contains(Candidate candidate)` — Checks whether a candidate exists inside `internalList` using `Candidate#isSameCandidate` to define equality.
* `UniqueCandidateList#setCandidate(Candidate target, Candidate editedCandidate)` — Replaces the Candidate object(target) in the `internalList` to the newly edited Candidate object(editedCandidate) through `List#set(int index, E element)`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasCandidate(Candidate candidate)` and `Model#updateCandidate(Candidate target, Candidate editedCandidate)` respectively.

===== Companies
The edit mechanism for companies is facilitated by `EditCompanyDescriptor` in `EditCompanyCommand` which creates a new Company object with edited attributes
and `UniqueCompanyList` which stores companies internally as an `internalList` which is a list of Company objects.
Additionally, it implements the following operations to support the editing of companies.

* `UniqueCompanyList#contains(Company company)` — Checks whether a company exists inside `internalList` using `Company#isSameCompany` to define equality.
* `UniqueCompanyList#setCompany(Company target, Company editedCompany)` — Replaces the Company object(target) in the `internalList` to the newly edited Company object(editedCompany) through `List#set(int index, E element)`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasCompany(Company company)` and `Model#updateCompany(Company target, Company editedCompany)` respectively.

===== Job Offers
The edit mechanism for job offers is facilitated by `EditJobOfferDescriptor` in `EditJobDetailsCommand` which creates a new Job Offer object with edited attributes
and `UniqueJobList` which stores job offers internally as an `internalList` which is a list of Job Offer objects.
Additionally, it implements the following operations to support the editing of job offers.

* `UniqueJobList#contains(JobOffer jobOffer)` — Checks whether a job offer exists inside `internalList` using `JobOffer#isSameJobOffer` to define equality.
* `UniqueJobList#setJobOffer(JobOffer target, JobOffer editedJobOffer)` — Replaces the Job Offer object(target) in the `internalList` to the newly edited Job Offer object(editedJobOffer) through `List#set(int index, E element)`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasJobOffer(JobOffer jobOffer)` and `Model#updateJobOffer(JobOffer target, JobOffer editedJobOffer)` respectively.

[NOTE]
The editing of all three entities(Candidate, Company, JobOffer) follow the same mechanism.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches RecruitBook for the first time.

.. `UniqueCandidateList` will be initialised with the list of saved candidates in RecruitBook
.. `UniqueCompanyList` will be initialised with the list of saved companies in RecruitBook
.. `UniqueJobList` will be initialised with the list of saved job offers.
[NOTE]
Assume that upon initialisation, there are candidate, company and job offer entries in RecruitBook.

Step 2. The user executes ...

.. `editc 1 n/John Doe` to edit the name of the 1st person in the RecruitBook.
... The name attribute in `EditPersonDescriptor` in `EditCandidateCommand` has been set to "John Doe" and the descriptor is used to compare with the original Candidate object and a new Candidate object is created with the name being "John Doe".
... `EditCandidateCommand` then calls `Model#hasCandidate(Candidate candidate)` to check if the edited candidate has a duplicate in the RecruitBook. If not, `Model#updateCandidate(Candidate target, Candidate editedCandidate)` is then called that replaces the original Candidate object with the newly edited one.
.. `editC 1 c/KFC` to edit the name of the 1st company in the RecruitBook.
... The name attribute in `EditCompanyDescriptor` in `EditCompanyCommand` has been set to "KFC" and the descriptor is used to compare with the original Company object and a new Company object is created with the name being "KFC".
... `EditCompanyCommand` then calls `Model#hasCompany(Company company)` to check if the edited company has a duplicate in the RecruitBook. If not, `Model#updateCompany(Company target, Company editedCompany)` is then called that replaces the original Company object with the newly edited one.
.. `editj 1 j/Cashier` to edit the job title of the 1st job offer in the RecruitBook.
... The job title attribute in `EditJobOfferDescriptor` in `EditJobDetailsCommand` has been set to "Cashier" and the descriptor is used to compare with the original JobOffer object and a new JobOffer object is created with the job title being "Cashier".
... `EditJobDetailsCommand` then calls `Model#hasJobOffer(JobOffer jobOffer)` to check if the edited job offer has a duplicate in the RecruitBook. If not, `Model#updateJobOffer(JobOffer target, JobOffer editedJobOffer)` is then called that replaces the original JobOffer object with the newly edited one.
[NOTE]
Any duplicates formed after editing will not replace the original object. It will prompt an error message

==== Design Considerations

===== How edit executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Replaces the original object with an edited one.
** Pros: If the edited object were to result in errors, it can be prevented from replacing the original object.
** Cons: It is less efficient as compared to editing the original object straightaway.
* **Alternative 2:** Editing the original object instead of replacing it with an edited one.
** Pros: It is more intuitive and efficient.
** Cons: The edited object cannot be checked for duplicates without permanently changing the object first.

===== Data structure to support the edit command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separating the editing feature into 3 commands for different entities.
** Pros: Greater distinction between the entities.
** Cons: More commands to deal with (similar commands across all three entities).
* **Alternative 2:** Have a central `EditManager` that handles all edits.
** Pros: Reduction of command objects (less confusing).
** Cons: There is coupling between the manager and the individual commands. Changes to an entity has to be cascaded to the manager.
// end::edit[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort Feature
==== Current Implementation
===== Candidates

The sort mechanism of candidates is facilitated in `UniqueCandidateList` which stores candidates in an `internalList`. It implements the sorting of candidates using the following operations:

* `UniqueCandidateList#sortByName()` — Sorts the `internalList` of Candidates by their names.
* `UniqueCandidateList#sortByAge()` — Sorts the `internalList` of Candidates by their age.
* `UniqueCandidateList#sortByEmail()` — Sorts the `internalList` of Candidates by their emails.
* `UniqueCandidateList#sortByJob()` — Sorts the `internalList` of Candidates by their job titles.
* `UniqueCandidateList#sortByEducation()` — Sorts the `internalList` of Candidates by their education levels.
* `UniqueCandidateList#sortBySalary()` — Sorts the `internalList` of Candidates by their salaries.
* `UniqueCandidateList#sortInReverse()` — Sorts the `internalList` of Candidates in reverse order of their current order.

These operations are accessed through the `Model` interface as `Model#sortCandidates(Prefix prefix)` which then calls the respective sorting method by determining the prefix type in `CandidateBook`.
[NOTE]
These prefixes `/n`, `/x`,`/e`, `/j`, `/h`, `/s`, `/r` are used respectively to the methods shown above.

===== Companies

The sort mechanism of companies is facilitated in `UniqueCompanyList` which stores companies in an `internalList`. It implements the sorting of companies using the following operations:

* `UniqueCompanyList#sortByCompanyName()` — Sorts the `internalList` of Companies by their names.
* `UniqueCompanyList#sortByEmail()` — Sorts the `internalList` of Companies by their emails.
* `UniqueCompanyList#sortInReverse()` — Sorts the `internalList` of Companies in reverse order of their current order.

These operations are accessed through the `Model` interface as `Model#sortCompanies(Prefix prefix)` which then calls the respective sorting method by determining the prefix type in `CompanyBook`.
[NOTE]
These prefixes `/c`, `/e`, `/r` are used respectively to the methods shown above.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches RecruitBook for the first time.

.. `UniqueCandidateList` will be initialised with the list of saved candidates in `CandidateBook`.
.. `UniqueCompanyList` will be initialised with the list of saved companies in `CompanyBook`.

[NOTE]
Assume that upon initialisation, there are candidate and company entries in RecruitBook.

Step 2. The user executes...

.. `sortc s/` to sort the list of candidates based on their salaries.
... `s/` prefix is used which calls the `UniqueCandidateList#sortBySalary()` from `CandidateBook`.
... The `internalList` within `CandidateBook` is then sorted numerically based on salary and the newly sorted list will be reflected in the `MainWindow` of RecruitBook.
.. `sortC c/` to sort the list of companies based on their names.
... `c/` prefix is used which calls the `UniqueCompanyList`#sortByCompanyName()` from `CompanyBook`.
... The `internalList` within `CompanyBook` is then sorted lexicographically based on their names and the newly sorted list will be reflected in the `MainWindow` of RecruitBook.

Step 3. The user does not want the candidates to be sorted in increasing order but decreasing order. So, the user executes

.. `sortc /r` to sort the list of candidates in the reverse order of the current order.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How sort executes
* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Store the input prefix as a parameter to be passed in to the respective books which calls the respective method.
** Pros: The variations of sort methods are stored under `UniqueCandidateList` instead of having more command objects.
** Cons: Implementation of switch case statements in both books which could lead to poorer performance.
* **Alternative 2:** Create multiple sort commands for the various attributes.
** Pros: The implementation would give a better performance.
** Cons: There will be about 10 more newly added command objects which makes it confusing when dealing with many similar commands.

// end::sort[]

// tag::blacklist[]
=== Blacklist Feature
==== Current Implementation
The blacklist mechanism is facilitated by `UniqueCandidateList` that is stored in the CandidateBook (as `internalList`). This feature is also supported by `Model#getFilteredCandidateList` where the input index is used to obtain the Candidate object from the observable list.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `UniqueCandidateList#setCandidate(Candidate target, Candidate editedCandidate)` — Replaces the original Candidate object in the `internalList` with the newly edited Candidate object.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateCandidate(Candidate target, Candidate editedCandidate)`.

[NOTE]
There is *no* duplicate check as no two candidate objects share the same name and changing the tags (blacklist) does not violate the uniqueness of their names.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the blacklist command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches RecruitBook for the first time.

.. `UniqueCandidateList` is initialised with the saved data of Candidates in RecuitBook.

[NOTE]
Assume that upon initialisation, there are candidate entries in RecruitBook.

Step 2. The user executes `blacklist 1` command to blacklist the 1st candidate in the candidate book. If there are no errors, the 1st candidate will be blacklisted and a "BLACKLISTED" tag will appear in its entry.

.. It achieves this by generating a new Candidate object with a blacklist tag then replaces the original Candidate object in the `internalList`.

Step 3. The user executes `editc 1 n/James`. This command will fail to execute as blacklisted candidates cannot be edited or shortlisted. An error message will appear.

Step 4. The user decides that blacklisting the candidate was a mistake and proceeds to *remove* the blacklist.

.. `blacklist rm 1` is executed. The 1st candidate will no longer be blacklisted and the "BLACKLISTED" tag will be removed from its entry.
.. It achieves this by generating a new Candidate object without a blacklist tag which replaces the original blacklisted Candidate in the `internalList`.

[NOTE]
Trying to blacklist an already blacklisted candidate will prompt an error message. +
Unblacklisting a candidate who is not blacklisted will do likewise.

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: How blacklist executes

* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Creates a new  Candidate object for adding or removal of blacklist.
** Pros: Less error prone as compared to editing candidates straight.
** Cons: It is less efficient to regenerate objects as compared to directing editing of candidates.
* **Alternative 2:** Editing the tags of the Candidate directly.
** Pros: More intuitive and efficient.
** Cons: Code becomes less defensive as any changes will be permanent reflected in that candidate.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the blacklist command
* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Add blacklist tags into the candidates.
** Pros: Blacklisting can be immediately displayed on entries.
** Cons: There is no organised data structure that accommodates all blacklisted candidates, so if there is a need for all blacklisted candidates, every candidate has to be checked.
* **Alternative 2:** Store blacklisted candidates in a list.
** Pros: There is a one-stop collection of blacklisted candidates.
** Cons: To check if a candidate if blacklisted, a loop has to be used to check the list. (slows the execution of edit and shortlist).

// end::blacklist[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find Feature

The `find` command is used to find candidates or companies stored in the address book through either the `findc` (find Candidate) or `findC` (find company).
It extends `Command` and overrides two of its methods namely `CommandResult` and `equals`.

// end::find[]

// tag::shortlist[]
=== Shortlist Feature
==== Current Implementation
===== Shortlisting a Candidate

The shortlist mechanism is facilitated by `select`, `selectCompany` and `selectJob` command.
It extends `CompanyBook` with a list of shortlisted candidate(s) for each job offer, stored internally as a
Unique Candidate List called `candidateList`. The reason for storing as a unique list is to prevent duplicated
candidates from being added into the same `candidateList`.

It is a 5-stage process supported by `LogicManager` by keeping track of the `LogicState`.

. `primary`
. `SelectCompanyForShortlist`
. `SelectJobForShortlist`
. `SelectCandidate`
. `ShortlistCandidate`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the shortlist mechanism behaves at each step.

[NOTE]
x refers to the index from user input.

. User launches the application. RecruitBook sets up the Candidate Book and Company Book respectively.
[NOTE]
Assume that there are candidates and companies present in the data of RecruitBook, but no job offer.

. User adds a new job offer `Cashier` under the existing company `KFC`.
[NOTE]
Since RecruitBook opens up Candidate Book by default, adding a job offer will automatically switch the view to Company Book.

. RecruitBook creates a new object `Cashier` with `JobOffer` class. Hence, `Cashier` has `candidateList` as one of its attributes.
[NOTE]
`candidateList` is empty upon creation of the `Cashier` object.

. User executes `shortlist` command. RecruitBook enters Stage 2 of the shortlisting process to shortlist a candidate for a job offer.
This is implemented by `LogicManager` where `setLogicState` is called in each stage to connect one after another. User will need to execute
`cancel` command to exit from the shortlist process. The 5-stage process is described in order below.
.. `shortlist` -> User initializes the shortlisting process.
.. `selectCompany x` -> User selects the company of the job offer.
.. `selectJob x` -> User selects the job offer.
.. `select x` -> User selects the candidate to shortlist.
.. `confirm` -> User confirms the above inputs.

. RecruitBook proceeds to add shortlisted candidate through `Model`.
`ModelManager` connects the `candidateList` of the job offer in `JobOffer` class to `Model`, which then connects
to `Command`.
.  `Model.shortlistCandidateToJobOffer()` method adds the shortlisted candidate into the `candidateList`.
. `candidateList` is linked to the job offer.
[TIP]
You can access this list by calling `selectedJob.getUniqueCandidateList()`.

. `model.commitCompanyBook()` is then called to indicate that Company Book has been changed.
. RecruitBook exits the shortlisting process and returns your view to your last viewed book.

===== Deleting a Shortlisted Candidate

Deletion of a shortlisted candidate uses similar implementation as <<Shortlisting a Candidate>>.

The shortlist mechanism is facilitated by `selectCompany` and `selectJob` command.
It deletes a shortlisted candidate from the `candidateList` through `Model`.

It is a 4-stage process supported by `LogicManager` by keeping track of the `LogicState`.

. `primary`
. `SelectCompanyForShortlistDelete`
. `SelectJobForShortlistDelete`
. `DeleteShortlistedCandidate`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

[NOTE]
x refers to the index from user input.

. User launches the application. RecruitBook sets up the Candidate Book and Company Book respectively.
[NOTE]
Assume that there is at least one shortlisted candidate for the job offer selected by user.

. User executes `deleteShortlist` command.
[NOTE]
Since RecruitBook opens up Candidate Book by default, entering the delete process for shortlisted candidates
will automatically switch the view to Company Book.

. RecruitBook enters Stage 2 of the deleting process.
This is implemented by `LogicManager` where `setLogicState` is called in each stage to connect one after another. User will need to execute
`cancel` command to exit from the shortlist process. The 4-stage process is described in order below.
.. `deleteShortlist` -> User initializes the deleting process.
.. `selectCompany x` -> User selects the company of the job offer.
.. `selectJob x` -> User selects the job offer.
.. `delete x` -> User selects the candidate to delete.

. RecruitBook proceeds to delete the shortlisted candidate through `Model`.
`ModelManager` connects the `candidateList` of the job offer in `JobOffer` class to `Model`, which then connects
to `Command`.
.  `Model.deleteShortlistedCandidateFromJobOffer()` method deletes the shortlisted candidate from the `candidateList`.
[NOTE]
This command checks if the selected candidate exists inside `candidateList` by evaluating a boolean statement
`selectedJob.getUniqueCandidateList().contains(selectedCandidate)`. If the candidate does not exists inside the list,
this command returns a message to be displayed to inform the user.

. `model.commitCompanyBook()` is then called to indicate that Company Book has been changed.
. RecruitBook exits the deleting process.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How shortlist feature executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use existing `select`, `selectCompany` and `selectJob` commands.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Shortlist command executes the 5-stage process by itself.
** Pros: Does not need to rely on `LogicManager` to facilitate the process.
** Cons: We must implement 3 fields for user input `shortlist Candidate/[input] Company/[input] Job/[input]` and store separately from the
Candidate Book and Company Book. Furthermore, we have to filter by job offer and store the data into an observable list on the UI
when the user wants to view the shortlisted candidates for a certain job offer.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the shortlist feature

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the shortlisted candidates and attach this list to the respective job offer.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Increases coupling between `JobOffer` and `ShortlistCandidateCommand`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a HashMap to store the shortlisted candidates as the `key` and the respective job offers as the `value`.
** Pros: We do not need to set `shortlistedCandidateList` as an attribute in each the `JobOffer` object. This would use less memory as it only takes a HashMap to store
all the shortlisted candidates along with the job offers. Furthermore, this reduces coupling between `JobOffer` and `ShortlistCandidateCommand`.
** Cons: HashMap only allows unique `keys`. In other words, HashMap does not allow duplicates of candidates to be stored. However, in RecruitBook, user should
be able to shortlist a candidate for multiple job offers. Hence, we need to further implement a list of job offers to be stored as the `value` for each candidate so as
to store multiple job offers under the same candidate `key`.
// end::shortlist[]

// tag::switch[]
=== Switch Book Feature
==== Current Implementation
The switching mechanism is facilitated by `MainWindow`, with the latter's `switchToCandidateBook` and `switchToCompanyBook` methods.

It extends `Command` with `EventsCenter`, where it uses `EventsCenter` to post a new `SwitchBookRequestEvent` so that
MainWindow will handle the event with its `handleSwitchBookEvent` method.

[NOTE]
MainWindow knows an event is posted because it is subscribed to the event bus `com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe`. It will
handle any event that matches the parameter of the handling methods in `MainWindow` class.
For example, `SwitchBookRequestEvent` will match with the `handleSwitchBookEvent(*SwitchBookRequestEvent* event)` as the parameter matches.

As mentioned <<UI component, above>>, inside MainWindow, there are 4 placeholders and the panelViewPlaceholder holds the panels `CandidateDetailsPanel` and `CompanyJobDetailsPanel`.

The methods `switchToCandidateBook` and `switchToCompanyBook` work by placing the desired panel in panelViewPlaceholder, to be shown on the MainWindow.

Given below is an example usage scenario for switching from `Candidate Book` to `Company Book` and how the switching mechanism behaves at each step.

. User launches the application. `MainWindow` initialises the panelViewPlaceholder with `CandidateDetailsPanel`.
[NOTE]
This means the default view of RecruitBook is the `Candidate Book`.

. User executes `switch` command, which posts a `SwitchBookRequestEvent`.

. MainWindow handles the posted `SwitchBookRequestEvent` with its method `handleSwitchBookEvent`.

. Inside this method, it checks which book is currently displayed by calling the method `getDisplayedBook`.

. `getDisplayedBook` returns `candidateBook` as a string.

. Using a switch statement, case `candidateBook` will execute and call for `switchToCompanyBook` method.

. `switchToCompanyBook` method places the `CompanyJobDetailsPanel` into panelViewPlaceholder to switch the view
[TIP]
In order to add a panel into `panelViewPlaceholder`, the existing panel needs to be removed so that there will not be duplicated panels
inside `panelViewPlaceholder`. There will be a compilation error if there are duplicated panels.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How switch feature executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `EventsCenter` to post events and `MainWindow` to handle these events.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Neat and clean code with less coupling. `MainWindow` has private methods and variables to prevent unauthorised access
for better integrity purposes.
** Cons: -
* **Alternative 2:** Allow all methods in MainWindow to be static and public.
** Pros: Other classes can have easy access to the switching methods and their variables.
** Cons: May face integrity issues due to public access of MainWindow. Increases unnecessary coupling.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the switch feature
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The only variable that `MainWindow` has to keep track of is `currentBook`.
** Pros: Easy to keep track as `currentBook` is set to `candidateBook` or `companyBook` accordingly.
** Cons: `currentBook` is a string variable. Misspelling of `candidateBook` or `companyBook` in code may result in a bug.
* **Alternative 2:** Store `currentBook` as boolean `isCandidateBook`, with the boolean returning true if the current book is Candidate Book,
and returning false if the current book is Company Book.
** Pros: Eliminates the possibility of misspelling the books.
** Cons: Can be confusing for multiple contributors. There is also an assumption that there are only 2 distinct
cases of the view of `panelViewPlaceholder`, which is not the case as we introduced another view `shortlistPanel`.
// end::switch[]

// tag::email[]
=== Email command
==== Current Implementation
The email command is facilitated by `EmailInitialiseCommand`, `EmailRecipientsCommand`, `EmailContentsCommand` and `EmailSendCommand`
classes which extends the `Command` class, and `EmailUtil` attribute in `Model` which stores variables and methods pertaining to the email command
and the `EmailSettings` class which stores email subject and email body text settings.

._Some of these classes also contain children classes which act as sub-commands:_
. `EmailRecipientsAddCommand`, `EmailRecipientsNextCommand` extends `EmailRecipientsSelectCommand`.
. `EmailContentsAddCommand`, `EmailContentsBackCommand` and `EmailContentsNextCommand` extends `EmailContentsSelectCommand`.
. `EmailSendBackCommand`, `EmailSendPreviewCommand` and `EmailSendSendCommand` extends `EmailSendCommand`.

The email command is a 4-stage process supported by `LogicManager` by keeping track of the `LogicState`.

. `EmailInitialiseCommand`
. `EmailRecipientsCommand`
. `EmailContentsCommand`
. `EmailSendCommand`

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the email command behaves at each step.

. The user launches the application. The application loads email settings from `preferences.json` which is stored in `Model#EmailUtil`.

. The user executes the `email` command. A new `EmailUtil` object is constructed and replaces the `EmailUtil` object in `Model`.
  `LogicState` is changed to reflect initialisation of the email command and to move it into recipients selection stage
. The user executes the `add` command for the first time. This calls `EmailRecipientsAddCommand`.
.. In `EmailRecipientsAddCommand`, `EmailUtil#hasRecipientsAdded` boolean value will be changed to true.
.. `MainWindow#getCurrentBook()` is called to determine the current book that the user is on and
   `EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates` boolean value will be changed accordingly
... If recipients are candidates, `EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates` will be true.
... If recipients are companies, `EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates` will be false.
.. Depending on `EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates`, the recipient objects are called with `Model#getFilteredCandidateList`
   or `Model#getFilteredJobList` and are stored in a linked hash set within `EmailUtil`. +
   Using `LinkedHashSet#add()` boolean return value, it is possible to determine if object added is a duplicate.
   Duplicates are not added and are noted down inside an `ArrayList` within `EmailRecipientsAddCommand` which will be
   reflected back to the user.
. The user executes another `add` command to add more recipients. This calls `EmailRecipientsAddCommand`
.. If `MainWindow#getCurrentBook()` and `EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates` do not match, user will be notified and nothing will be done.
   This is to prevent adding different objects into the recipients linked hash set.
.. If `MainWindow#getCurrentBook()` and `EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates` match, then adds recipients as seen above.
. The user executes `next` command. This calls `EmailRecipientsNextCommand` which based on
  `EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates`, switches the current book and changes `LogicState` to select contents phase.
[NOTE]
In `EmailContentSelectionCommand` phase, depending on `EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates`, the current book will be locked and only
  commands pertaining to the current book can be used. This is to enforce that recipients and contents must be contrasting.
. The user executes `add` command. This calls `EmailContentsAddCommand` which adds contents similarly to `EmailRecipientsAddCommand` as seen above.
. The user executes `back` command. This calls `EmailContentsBackCommand` which switches the current book and changes `LogicState` back to select recipients phase.
. The user executes `next` command. This calls `EmailRecipientsNextCommand` which switches the current book and changes `LogicState` to select contents phase.
. The user executes `next` command. This calls `EmailContentsNextCommand` which changes `LogicState` to the send phase.
. The user executes `preview` command. This calls `EmailSendPreviewCommand`.
.. This generates a string of the email based on recipients and contents in `EmailUtil` which calls `EventCenter` to post `ShowEmailPreviewEvent`
   with the email String and shows the string in a new window, `EmailPreview`.
. The user is satisfied with the preview and executes the `send` command. This generates the email as a `MimeMessage`
  which is the Java format used for emails and is sent via `EmailUtil#sendMessage`. `LogicState` is reset back to orignal and this marks the end of the email command.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Data structure to store recipients and candidates

* **Alternative 1:** Array List
** Pros: General purpose data structure that will work for this use case
** Cons: Checking for duplicates is not efficient. Each insertion requires a comparison across all elements in the array.

* **Alternative 2:** Hash Set
** Pros: Does not allow duplicates and indicates if an object being added is successful or not.
** Cons: Does not maintain the order in which objects were added in.

* **Alternative 3 (current choice):** Linked Hash Set
** Pros: Does not allow duplicates, indicates if an object being added is successful or not,
   and maintains order in which objects were added in.
** Cons: -

// end::email[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCandidateBook`.
It extends `CandidateBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `candidateBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCandidateBook#commit()` -- Saves the current candidate book state in its history.
* `VersionedCandidateBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous candidate book state from its history.
* `VersionedCandidateBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone candidate book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCandidateBook()`, `Model#undoCandidateBook()` and `Model#redoCandidateBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCandidateBook` will be initialized with the initial candidate book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single candidate book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th candidate in the candidate book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCandidateBook()`, causing the modified state of the candidate book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `candidateBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted candidate book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `addc n/David ...` to add a new candidate. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCandidateBook()`, causing another modified candidate book state to be saved into the `candidateBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCandidateBook()`, so the candidate book state will not be saved into the `candidateBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the candidate was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCandidateBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous candidate book state, and restores the candidate book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial candidate book state, then there are no previous candidate book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCandidateBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoCandidateBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the candidate book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `candidateBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest candidate book state, then there are no undone candidate book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCandidateBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the candidate book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCandidateBook()`, `Model#undoCandidateBook()` or `Model#redoCandidateBook()`. Thus, the `candidateBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCandidateBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `candidateBookStateList`, all candidate book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire candidate book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the candidate being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of candidate book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedCandidateBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.recruit.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.recruit.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.recruit.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.recruit.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recruit/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, candidate book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*: Job Agents, Recruit executives, Human Resources executives

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts and job offers
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

By: `Team F09-1`      Since: `Sep 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

Given below is the Object Diagram that shows the associations between various objects within the `Logic` component for the Login functionality.
[[fig-LoginLogicObjectDiagram]]
.Associations between objects in the Logic Component for Login feature
image::LoginLogicObjectDiagram.png[width="800"]

.  `LogicManager` creates a new instance of `AddressBookParser`, which takes in the user login input details.
.  This results in the simultaneous instantiation of `LoginUserIdPasswordRoleCommandParser` object and the calling of parse() method on the object.
.  From the parsing of user input, three objects, idPredicate, passwordPredicate and rolePredicate, which belongs to `UserIdContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `UserPasswordContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `UserRoleContainsKeywordsPredicate` respectively, are instantiated and passed as parameters in the instantiation of a `LoginUserIdPasswordRoleCommand` object.
.  Depending on the user input, some of the booleans in `LoginManager` may be set to true.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* stores the Club Budget Elements Book data.
* stores the Final Budgets Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* similarly exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ClubBudgetElements>` and `ObservableList<FinalClubBudget>` that can be 'observed'.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

Given below is the Object Diagram that shows the associations between various objects within the `Model` component for the Login functionality.
[[fig-LoginModelObjectDiagram]]
.Associations between objects in the Model Component for Login feature
image::LoginModelObjectDiagram.png[width="800"]

.  `filteredLoginDetails` will always show all accounts when `ModelManager` is first instantiated.
.  Depending on the user input during login, `filteredLoginDetails` will be gradually filtered according to matching user id first, followed by user password and then, user role.
.  Whether or not the login is a success or a failure, will depend on if there is an account left in the list after the list is filtered.
.  The existing user id, user password and user role fields in the `filteredLoginDetails` accounts list will not be edited in any way.

Given below is the Object Diagram for the various associations between objects in the Model Component for the `budget` command, which is the first step of th Budgeting feature

Given below is the Object Diagram for the various associations between objects in the Model Component for the `calculatebudget` command, which is the second step of the Budgeting feature.

image::BudgetCalculationCommandObjectDiagram.png[width="800"]

. `filteredClubsList` and `filteredClubBudgetsList` are empty when `ModelManager` is first initialised.
. The details of the attributes of the ClubBudgetElements and FinalClubBudget objects stored respectively in the `filteredClubsList` and `filteredClubBudgetsList` cannot be edited in any way.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

Given below is the Object Diagram that shows the associations between various objects within the `Storage` component for the new account creation functionality.
[[fig-LoginStorageObjectDiagram]]
.Associations between objects in the Storage Component for account creation feature
image::LoginStorageObjectDiagram.png[width="800"]

.  `XmlAccount` is instantiated, with the appropriate account details as parameters for the new `XmlAccount` object.
.  An `List<XmlAccount>` object is instantiated, with the previous `XmlAccount` object containing the new account's details to be added into the `List<XmlAccount>` object in `XmlSerializableLoginBook`.
.  The resulting `LoginBook` is then serialized to Xml format in `XmlSerializableLoginBook`.
.  With a new `XmlSerializableLoginBook` object instantiated with the account details in a `LoginBook` object, the `XmlSerializableLoginBook` object is then passed as a parameter when the save method in `XmlLoginBookStorage` is called, to save to a location according the the `Path` specified.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::login[]
=== Login system feature
==== Current Implementation

The login mechanism utilizes an existing Java library, `FilteredList`, in order to filter out the relevant
account that is associated with an instance of a successful login. An object belonging to the `FilteredList` class, called
`filteredLoginDetails`, is instantiated at the start of the application. The `filteredLoginDetails` object initially
contains a complete list of all existing accounts stored in `LoginBook`. There is one crucial operation in `FilteredList`,
which is often used:

* `FilteredList#setPredicate(predicate)` -- Filters accounts in `filteredLoginDetails` according to the
predicates determined after the user inputs their login details.

`ModelManager` implements `updateFilteredLoginDetailsList(Predicate<LoginDetails> predicate)` and
`getFilteredLoginDetailsList()` found in the `Model` interface. `getFilteredLoginDetailsList()` is called when the
list of accounts in `LoginBook` is filtered to the extent where only one or no account remains in the list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the login mechanism behaves at each step. The sequence diagram below
demonstrates the flow of operation and interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` component in the login mechanism.
The diagram shows what happens when the user inputs the correct login details.

image::LoginSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

Step 1. You launch the application for the first time. The `filteredLoginDetails` object will be initialized with
a list of all the accounts in `LoginBook`.

image::InitialLoginBookList.PNG[width="240"]

Step 2. You execute `login A1234568M zaq1xsw2cde3 member` command in the input box that matches an account in
`LoginBook`. `LogicManager` then calls `ParseCommand(login A1234568M zaq1xsw2cde3 member)` in `AddressBookParser`.

image::CorrectIdPasswordRole.PNG[width="200"]

Step 3. `AddressBookParser` instantiates the `LoginUserIdPasswordRoleCommandParser` object and simultaneously calls the `parse(args)` method, returning
an `LoginUserIdPasswordRoleCommand` object with the user input, parsed, to `AddressBookParser` and `LogicManager`.

Step 4. `LogicManager` calls the `execute()` method in `LoginUserIdPasswordRoleCommand`. Next, `LoginUserIdPasswordRoleCommand`
calls `updateFilteredLoginDetailsList(updatedIdPredicate)` in `Model` with the computed predicate from user ID field input.

Step 5. `Model` calls `setPredicate(updatedIdPredicate)` in `FilteredList`, filtering accounts whose user Id is a
mismatch with updatedIdPredicate. `filteredLoginDetails` is updated as shown below.

image::ParseCorrectLoginDetailList.PNG[width="200"]

Step 6. `LoginUserIdPasswordRoleCommand` calls `updateFilteredLoginDetailsList(updatedPassPredicate)` in `Model` with the
computed predicate from user password field input.

Step 7. `Model` calls `setPredicate(updatedPasswordPredicate)` in `FilteredList`, which then further filters out accounts
whose password is a mismatch with updatedPasswordPredicate. `filteredLoginDetails` is further updated as shown below.

image::ParseCorrectLoginDetailList.PNG[width="200"]

Step 8. `LoginUserIdPasswordRoleCommand` calls `updateFilteredLoginDetailsList(updatedRolePredicate)` in `Model` with the
computed predicate from user role field input.

Step 9. `Model` calls `setPredicate(updatedRolePredicate)` in `FilteredList`, which then further filters out accounts
whose role is a mismatch with updatedRolePredicate. `filteredLoginDetails` is further updated as shown below.

image::ParseCorrectLoginDetailList.PNG[width="200"]

[NOTE]
After step 9 is done, there should only be one account left in the list, assuming that the user input the correct login
details. As the loginbook does not allow duplicate accounts with the same user ID field as another account, there should
not be two or more accounts left in the list.

[NOTE]
In step 2, if you execute `login A1234566M zaq1xsw2cde janitor` command instead, the application will continue with steps
2 to 7, but instead of one account remaining at the end of the filtering process, there will be no account in the updated
list as shown in the image below.

image::WrongIdPasswordRole.PNG[width="200"]
image::WrongIdOrPasswordOrRoleList.PNG[width="200"]

[NOTE]
In step 2, if you give a blank input for the login command instead, the application will throw a new ParseException
and consider the login attempt as unsuccessful and initiate a new pop-up window asking you for input of login
credentials again, as shown in the image below.

image::BlankLoginInput.PNG[width="200"]

[NOTE]
In step 2, if the input has either the id, password or role missing instead, the application will
throw ParseException, consider the login attempt as unsuccessful and initiate a new pop-up window asking you for input of login credentials again, as shown in the image below.

image::MissingLoginInput.PNG[width="200"]

In all cases where you input either the wrong ID, password, or role, there will be no account left in the account list when `getFilteredLoginDetailsList` method in `Model` is called. The `isLoginSuccessful` boolean in `LoginManager` will be set to false via the setter method, `setIsLoginSuccessful` in `LoginManager`. This is done by the `checkUpdatedAccountListSetLoginCondition` method in `LoginUserIdPasswordRoleCommand`. The `initializeLoginProcess` method in `MainWindow` will be called repeatedly until `isLoginSuccessful` is set to true. The sequence diagram below shows the high level workflow of the login mechanism in the event of log-in failure.

image::RepeatLoginSequenceDiagram.png[width="200"]

The activity diagrams below shows the overall picture of how the login mechanism works.

image::LoginActivityDiagram.png[width="400"]
image::LoginExtendedActivityDiagram.png[width="400"]

==== Design Considerations

This section touches on the design considerations encountered during the project in the implementation of the login feature, different alternatives in different design aspects, and its advantages and disadvantages.

===== Aspect: How login data is stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves login credentials in loginbook.xml in XML format.
** Pros: Easier to read, and versioning is possible.
** Cons: XML data file takes up more storage space.
* **Alternative 2:** Saves login credentials using JSON.
** Pros: Does not take up a lot of space.
** Cons: Harder to read.
// end::login[]

//tag::budget[]
=== Budgeting Feature
==== Current Implementation

This feature has been implemented through 3 separate commands, each dealing with a separate stage in the calculation and
subsequent allocation of budgets by the NUSSU Executive Committee to all the clubs that submit the data required to
calculate the budget. The three commands are: `budget` - which handles the submission of data by the club treasurer required to
calculate the budget for that club, `calculatebudget` - which is to be used only by the NUSSU Executive Committee members
in order to calculate the budgets for each club and `viewbudget` - which lists the final budgets of all the clubs.

===== Submission of Data

Given below is an example usage scenario and the behaviour at each step of the `budget` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. 'filteredClubsList' will be initialised with an empty list
of all the clubs' budget calculation data in the address book. Similarly 'filteredClubBudgets' will be initialised with an empty list of all the club budgets in the address book.

Step 2. The user (a club member) executes `budget c/Computing Club t/200 e/5` command in order to submit the data for the calculation of her club's budget. The 'LogicManager' then calls the 'parseCommand' in the
'AddressBookParser'.

Step 3. The 'AddressBookParser' then returns a new 'BudgetCommandParser', if the user is of the *member* role. (Else a parse exception is thrown.)

Step 4. The 'BudgetCommandParser' parses the command to be executed and creates a 'ClubBudgetElements' object called 'club' with the club's name, the expected turnout and the number of events, as specified by the user. Finally the 'BudgetCommand' is called with 'club' as the argument.

Step 5. The 'BudgetCommand' checks whether the 'club' is a duplicate and if it is not, the 'BudgetCommand' calls the 'addClub' method in 'Model' with 'club' as the argument.

Step 6. 'Model' calls 'addClub' in 'ReadOnlyClubBudgetElementsBook' and indicates that the club budget elements book's status has changed.

Step 7. 'ReadOnlyClubBudgetElementsBook' calls the 'addClub' command on an object 'clubs' of the 'UniqueClubsList' class, thus
adding the required club's data to the club budget elements book.

Step 8. Finally a success message is displayed with the details that have been entered by the user.

[NOTE]
As mentioned in Step 5, had the user entered a club name that already existed in the list of clubs in the address book, then a duplicate club budget elements message would be shown, prompting the user to edit their entered command and try again. Execution of subsequent steps would be stopped until the
user entered a unique club name.

The image below is the sequence diagram for the functioning of the `budget` command:

image::BudgetCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Calculation and allocation of budgets

Given below is an example usage scenario and the behaviour at each step of the `calculatebudget` command.

Step 1. 'filteredClubsList' will no longer be an empty list, and will now contain the budget calculation data of the clubs that have been added using the `budget` command.

Step 2. The user (a NUSSU treasurer) executes the `calculatebudget b/50000` command with '50000' as the total available budget, in order to calulate and allocate all the clubs' budgets. The 'LogicManager' then calls the 'parseCommand' in the
'AddressBookParser'.

Step 3. The 'AddressBookParser' then returns a new 'BudgetCalculationCommandParser', if the user is of the role *treasurer*. (Else a parse exception is thrown.)

Step 4.'BudgetCalculationCommandParser' parses the command and creates a 'TotalBudget' object called 'totalBudget' with the total available budget specified by the user. Finally the 'BudgetCalculationCommand' is called with 'totalBudget' as the argument.

Step 5. The 'BudgetCalculationCommand' checks whether the 'totalBudget' is a negative number. It also checks whether the budgets have already been calculated before using the getHaveBudgetsBeenCalculated method of the 'BudgetCalculationManager'. It also checks whether the clubBudgetElementsBook is empty. If none of this are true, then the 'filteredClubsList' is iterated through to calculate the budget, an object 'toAdd' of the 'FinalClubBudget' class, of each club in the list. When the budget for a club has been calculated, the 'BudgetCalculationCommand' calls the 'addClubBudget' method in Model with 'toAdd' as the parameter.

Step 6. 'Model' calls 'addClubBudget' in 'ReadOnlyFinalBudgetBook' and indicates that the finalBudgetsBook's status has changed.

Step 7. 'ReadOnlyFinalBudgetBook' calls the 'addClubBudget' command on an object 'clubBudgets' of the 'UniqueClubBudgetsList' class, thus adding the required club's allocated budget to the finalClubBudgetsBook. The process repeats until the budget for every club in the 'filteredClubsList' has been calculated and allocated.

Step 8. Once the budget for every club has been allocated a success message is displayed, telling the user that the budgets have been calculated.

The image below is a sequence diagram for the 'BudgetCalculationCommand'

image::BudgetCalculationCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Viewing the allocated budgets

Given below is an example usage scenario and the behaviour at each step of the `viewbudget` command.

Step 1. 'filteredClubBudgetsList' will no longer be an empty list, and will now contain the final budgets that have been allocated to each of the clubs in the 'filteredClubsList'.

Step 2. The user (a NUSSU treasurer, a club member or even a club's President) executes the `viewbudget c/Computing Club` command to view the budget allocated to the club that she has specified (in this case the Computing Club). The 'LogicManager' then calls the 'AddressBookParser'.

Step 3. The 'AddressBookParser' then returns a new ViewClubBudgetsCommandParser' if the user role is set to either *member*, *treasurer* or *president*.

Step 4. The 'ViewClubBudgetsCommandParser' then creates a 'ClubName' object called clubName. Finally the 'ViewClubBudgetsCommand' is called with 'clubName' as the argument.

Step 5. 'ViewClubBudgetsCommand' checks whether the budgets have been calculated already. If they have not, an error message is shown to the user. If they have, then the 'filteredClubBudgetsList' is looped through to find a 'FinalClubBudget' object with the same 'ClubName' as the 'clubName' that is specified by the user (in this case 'Computing Club'). If it is found, then the associated 'allocatedBudget' of that 'FinalClubBudget' object is displayed to the user. Else a message saying that the specified club's budget does not exist is shown to the user.

The image below is a sequence diagram for the 'ViewClubBudgetsCommand'

image::ViewClubBudgetsCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How club budget elements data and final club budgets data is stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saving club budget elements data and final club budgets in budgetelements.xml and budgets.xml respectively in XML format.
** Pros: It is easy to read.
** Cons: XML data files takes up more storage space, also more verbose.
* **Alternative 2:** Saving club budget elements data and final club budgets using JSON.
** Pros: Faster and takes less storage space
** Cons: Less intuitive or readable since items are presented in a manner that is more similar to the code.

===== Aspect: How the final club budgets are stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Currently the final club budgets are stored in a list (which is accessed when using the `viewbudget` command).
** Pros: Easier to implement, with respect to the project's time constraints
** Cons: Not a good choice with respect to time complexity. If the list of final club budgets is very large, then looping through it in worst case time complexity of O(N) to find the desired club's budget, is very slow. Thus not allowing the NFR of speed to be achieved.
* **Alternative 2:** Using a map to store the final club budgets
** Pros: Far faster to search for the desired club's final budget given that Club Names must be unique.
** Cons: Would take longer to implement.

==== Possible Extensions

* Implementing an `editbudget` command to allow the club members to edit the budget calculation data until the treasurers have calculated and allocated the budgets.
* Allowing the NUSSU treasurers to calculate and allocate the budgets multiple times. This will allow them to change the total budget as and when needed and also allow club members to keep submitting their budget calculation data.

//end::budget[]

// tag::searchpruning[]
=== Search Pruning Feature

The Search Pruning mechanism is facilitated by the `SearchHistoryManager` class, and within it is a `searchHistoryStack` that stores `Predicate` objects.
`Predicate` objects are used to filter `FilteredList` objects by calling the `setPredicate()` method of `FilteredList`. By storing `Predicate` objects
in SearchHistoryManager, it stores the search logic that was previously used by the `FilteredList` object, and hence, simulates the storing Search History
without storing the actual data.

In NUSSU Connect, the main `SearchHistoryManger` object is in `ModelManager` and it stores `Predicate<Person>` objects used for the filtering of `filteredPersons` list.

NOTE: If you want to utilize `SearchHistoryManager` for your own use case, you can initialize a new `SearchHistoryManager` object with its' generic constructor.

==== Current Implementation

The main implementation behind `SearchHistoryManager` is a Stack Data Structure and the following 4 methods of `SearchHistoryManager` are exposed for your usage +

* `executeNewSearch(Predicate<T> predicate)` +
updates system search logic to the next state and returns a `Predicate` object storing the system search logic after the update.
* `revertLastSearch()` +
reverts system search logic to the previous state and returns a `Predicate` object storing
                       the system search logic after revert.
* `clearSearchHistory()` +
clears all system search logic from in-app memory. +
* `isEmpty()` +
returns true if `searchHistoryStack` is empty. +

Given below are illustrations to help you understand how the first three method works internally.
But before carrying on, you need to take note of the following.

NOTE: In the diagrams, 'UP' is the short-form for User Predicate and 'SP' is the short-form for System Predicate.
 User Predicate stores the logic specified by the user and it is not the actual search logic used for filtering of FilteredList objects.
 On the other hand, System Predicate stores the search logic for the system and it will be used to filter FilteredList objects.

NOTE: User Predicate and System Predicate are not actual Classes and they are simply there to help simplify the explanation.
In the actual implementation, there is no way to differentiate one from the other.

'''
**executeNewSearch(Predicate<T> predicate)** +

Upon calling this method, there will be two different situations +

* *Situation 1*: `searchHistoryStack` is empty +
Upon receiving a new User Predicate, SearchHistoryManager will simply push the new User Predicate into `searchHistoryStack`
as a System Predicate.

image::executeNewSearchEmptyStack.png[width="550"]

* *Situation 2*: `searchHistoryStack` is not empty +
Before pushing the new `Predicate` into the stack, `SearchHistoryManager` will first retrieve the System Predicate object at the top of the stack.
After retrieving it, it will call the `and()` method with the User Predicate, creating a new System Predicate which will then be pushed into the top
of the stack.

image::executeNewSearchNonEmptyStack.png[width="700"]
This method will return the new System Predicate at the top of the stack.

'''
**revertLastSearch()** +

This method will pop the System Predicate at the top of the stack.
In the event that the stack is already empty, this method will throw `EmptyHistoryException`.

image::undoSearchHistoryStack.png[width="400"]
If the stack is not empty after the pop, this method will return the System Predicate at the top of the stack. Else,
it will return a `Predicate` object with a search logic that always defaults to true.

'''
**clearSearchHistory()** +

This method will simply empty the stack.

image::clearSearchHistoryStack.png[width="350"]

'''

===== How SearchHistory
The following sequence diagrams shows you how the `IncludeNameFindCommand` and `UndoFind` commands
utilize `SearchHistoryManager` to perform Search Pruning. Other variations of `FindCommand` works similarly to
`IncludeNameFindCommand` and the sequence diagram for `IncludeNameFindCommand` is also relevant to them.

 - `UndoFind` command +

image::UndoFindSequenceDiagram.png[]


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: What data is stored in search history stack +

* **Alternative 1(current choice):**  Save a Stack of `Predicate` objects
** Pros:
    . Does not need to store the data in search history explicitly which saves memory +
    . `SearchHistoryManager` class is reusable for any Search Pruning done with `Predicate` +

** Cons:
. Developers need to understand how `Predicate` works before utilizing `SearchHistoryManager` to perform Search Pruning.
. `Predicate` objects by itself does not perform the Search Pruning. We have to make an additional call to the
  `setPredicate()` method of the `FilteredList` class with the `Predicate` object.

* ** Alternative 2: ** Save a Stack of Lists containing `Person` objects in search history
** Pros:
    . It is easy to understand from the code that we are filtering according to `Person` objects.

** Cons:
    . More memory is required as `Person` objects has to be duplicated multiple times into a new Lists.
    . `SearchHistoryManager` can only be used for Search Pruning on objects that is a `Person`.

===== Aspect: How the Predicate at the top of the Stack is retrieved from SearchHistoryManager +

* **Alternative 1(current choice):** `Predicate` is returned from the methods `executeSearch()` and `revertLastSearch()`
** Pros:
    . No need for an extra method call to retrieve system search logic in the form of `Predicate` from `SearchHistoryManager`. +
** Cons:
    . No clear distinction between Update and Retrieval of system search logic. +

* ** Alternative 2: ** `Predicate` is not returned from the methods `executeSearch()` and `revertLastSearch()`, but is instead retrieved with another method.
** Pros:
    . Clearer distinction between Update and Retrieval of system search logic.

** Cons:
    . Need to perform 2 method calls separately to retrieve `Predicate` object from `SearchHistoryManager` after an update to search logic.
    . Need to implement another method specifically for retrieval of `Predicate` object.
    . Other developers utilizing `SearchHistoryManger` need to remember that they need to retrieve `Predicate` object from `SearchHistoryManager` separately
      after an update to search logic.

=== Add Skill Level Command

==== Current Implementation

The add skill mechanism builds on the `addressBookParser`. This as well
as it's subclass `addSkillCommandParser` ensures that the correct number of arguments
is given to the command.

You can observe how the application Logic handles the request to change a skill
in one particular scenario in the following steps:

Step 1. The user launches the application. The application boots up and lists all members.

Step 2. The user locates the person he wants to add on at Index 4. They execute the `asl 4 s/Photography l/60` command.

Step 3.'LogicManager' calls the 'parseCommand' in the 'AddressBookParser', which calls `AddSkillCommandParser` to
parse it.

Step 4. After parsing, the command is sent to the `Model` which alters the `Person` object by modifying their
`Skill` and `SkillLevel` properties.

Step 5. The result is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

The following is a sequence diagram illustrating the above.

image::asl_sequence.png[width="1000"]

**Usage:**

Before executing the command:

image::aslbefore.png[width="300"]
After executing the command:

image::aslafter.png[width="300"]

==== Alternate implementations

We considered two different ways to implement the Skill Class.

* **Alternative 1**: Combining both Skill and SkillLevel properties together into a single class.

** Pros: Resembles the real world, as there is a one-to-one mapping of Skill to SkillLevel.
** Cons: Harder to test, and violates Single Responsiblity Principle.

* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice)**: Separating the Skill and SkillLevel classes into different classes.

** Pros: Easier to test.
** Cons: Adds to the number of classes unnecessarily.

==== Possible extensions

* One possiblilty is to enhance the add command such that skills can be added together with the rest of the
information during addition of personal information.
* Another is to enhance the edit command, possibly depreciating the use of the add skill level command.
* Another is to enhance the storage such that multiple skills can be added per person.
// end::asl[]

=== Sort feature

This feature was implemented by implementing custom comparators in
`Person` class. You will be able to compare the values in each person which are used
as arguments to the `Sort`, which is a method of all instances of `List`.

1. A `FilteredList` (unmodifiable) is obtained from the `model` and is placed into an `ArrayList`,
which is modifiable.
2. `Sort` is called on the list, using custom comparators which can be found in the Person Class.
3. The items are deleted from the model and are replaced in the order of the `ArrayList`.

==== Possible extensions

* Currently, the `find` command doesn't work with the Sort Command. The two commands used together
would be quite powerful, so making them work together would be top priority for `v2.0`.
* It should also be possible to sort by reverse, and sort by multiple criteria at once.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**

image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

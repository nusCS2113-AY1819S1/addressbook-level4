== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::Ui[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="500"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `EventListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

// end::Ui[]
The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.


[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ProManageParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

// tag::Parser[]
[[Design-Parser]]
=== Parser component
[[fig-ParserClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Parser Component
image::ParserClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ProManageParser.java[`ProManageParser.java`]

. `ProManageParser` use children class of `CommandParser` (eg. ManagerParser) to parse the user command.
.  When login/logout command is executed, the CommandParser object within ProManageParser is changed accordingly to DefaultParser,
ManagerParser or EmployeeParser.
.  DefaultParser, ManagerParser or EmployeeParser are subclass of the abstract class CommandParser
.  This display the behaviour of polymorphism as ProManageParser will always pass the input into CommandParser
but its behaviour depends on implementation of its subclass.
.  Each of it subclass will only know commands that is according to the privilege level.
// end::Parser[]


// tag::Model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="620"]
// end::Model[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book and Event List data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

// tag::Storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
// end::Storage[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book and Event List data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


// tag::Sort[]

=== Event Sorting

==== Current Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by Comparator<Event>.
When the sort method for FXObservableList is called, it will take a Comparator object to be use for sorting the list.
The comparator is able to take in two Event class objects and compare the relative parameter values.
The parameter can be `EventName`, `Date` & `StartTime`.
To allow sorting of these parameters, there are three types of comparators.


image::SortNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="650"]

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Committing Event List after sorting
 * **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Commits and saves the entire event list.
** Pros: Easy to implement and able to use undo to the previous state.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Does not commit the event list.
** Pros: Will use less memory.
** Cons: Unable to use undo function to revert back to the previous view.

// end::Sort[]



// tag::Invite[]
=== Invite feature

==== Current Implementation

The `invite` command allows users to add attendees to an existing event, which is represented by an `Event` object.
The command currently only allows users to add a single person to an event at a time, based on the indices on the UI.
This command adds the to-be-invited `Person` 's email, which is unique, to the chosen `Event`, so that the attendees of a particular event is recorded.

The adding of attendees is facilitated by the class: `Attendees`, which consists of a list of emails of type `String`.

.Class Diagram of Event and Attendee class
image::EventAndAttendeeClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following is a more detailed description of the `Attendee` class:

*  `Attendees`
** Each `Event` object consist of an `Attendees` object, which is a list of the emails of the different `Person` attending the event.
** This class is a wrapper class around the internal representation of a `Set` of emails.
** Only the email of the `Person` is recorded in an `Event`, as the email should be unique and uneditable.

Storing only the *email* of `Person` in the `Attendees` object of `Event` saves memory storage and facilitates the `select`, `viewmine` and `selectEvent` feature.
As we select a person, we can simply iterate through the event list and check whether the person's email is in the attendees list.
Similarly, as we select an event, we can first obtain the list of emails from the `Attendees`, and filter the employee list accordingly.

This command only executes successfully if the event does not not clash with the person's schedule.

Given below is an illustration to describe the detection of whether two events clash, which is facilitated by the method `hasClash` in `Event`:

.Logic behind `Event#hasClash`
image::EventClashDiagram.png[width="450"]

Thus, to check whether the event clashes with an employee's schedule, we iterate through the `ObservableList<Event>` and check whether the `Event` 1) contains the employee's email in the `Attendee` and 2) clashes with the selected event.

****
`Event#hasClash` is widely used in other features such as `addEvent` and `editEvent` to ensure that

1. Different events are not held at the same location and time.

2. An employee do not have two events he/she needs to attend at the same time.
****

Implementation of `RemoveCommand` is similar to `InviteCommand`, but removes persons from `Attendees` of events instead.

==== Execution of Command

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the invite mechanism works.

For example, the user inputs `invite 1 to/1` to invite the 1st person in the address book to the 1st event in the event list.

Step 1. The command text is passed to an instance of the `LogicManager` class.

Step 2. The `LogicManager` instance calls `ProManageParser#parseCommand`, which parses the invite command phrase.

Step 3. `InviteCommandParser#parse` parses the person and event index. An instance of the `InviteCommand` encapsulating the two indices information is then returned after parsing.

Step 4. `Logic Manager` then executes this `InviteCommand` by calling `InviteCommand#execute`.

Step 5. The filtered person list and event list is first obtained by calling `PersonModel#getFilteredPersonList` and `EventModel#getFilteredEventList`. Based on the indices, the `Person` and `Event` is selected. Then, the `Person` object's email is obtained by calling `Person#getEmail`

Step 6. Two steps of verification is required before the person is invited to the event.

* First, `Event#hasAttendee` checks whether the person is already invited to the event.
* Second, `Model#hasClash` checks whether the event clashes with the person's schedule.

Step 7. After successful verification, the person's email is added to the obtained `Attendees` object. The new `Attendees` object is then added to a new copy of the `Event` object.

Step 8. The new `Event` object is updated to the model by calling `Model#updateEvent`.

Step 9. The `InviteCommand#execute` finally returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the execution of the `invite` command.

image::InviteSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: How to link `Person` and `Event`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves only the emails of the Persons in the Attendees of Events.
** Pros: Saves space. Able to filter EventList easily.
** Cons: Requires going through the entire list of EventList to obtain details of events attended by the person.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the entire information of Events for each Persons.
** Pros: Fast access to information of Events attended by any Persons.
** Cons: Takes up a lot of storage space and memory. Many repeated items within the storage files.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support `invite` command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `HashSet` to store persons emails.
** Pros: Easier and faster to retrieve or validate names stored. Able to handle duplicates easily.
** Cons: Sequence of persons added is lost. Currently, this feature is not important for the project.

* **Alternative 2:** Use `ArrayList` to store persons emails.
** Pros: Emails are stored in order of addition.
** Cons: Inefficient when handling data.

==== Future Improvements

===== Adding entire department or multiple persons to an event

The current `invite` command only invites one person to a chosen event based on the index chosen. This feature can be further extended to enable inviting more than one person or an entire department to an event.
One possible way to to implement this is to have the user

* input a certain range (2-5) or
* multiple indices (1,3,6,7,8) or
* input the department name

The same concept can also be applied to events, being able to invite one person to multiple events with one single command.

Implementation of this additional feature would require changes to both `InviteCommandParser` and `InviteCommand#execute`. Additionally, handling of clashing events needs to be considered as it now involves more than one participant and event.

Similar improvements can be made to `remove` command, being able to remove a person from a number of events with one single command.
// end::Invite[]

// tag::Select[]
=== Select feature

==== Current Implementation
The `select` command allows users to view the event schedules of an employee on a certain date, month, and year, or all of his/her events.
The command currently only allows users to view the event of a single employee, based on the indices of the employee list on the UI.
This command only executes successfully if the input index is valid (not out of bound).

The command is facilitated by the class: `Attendees`, a `HashSet` of emails of type `String`, as described in Section 3.2.1.

==== Execution of Command
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `select` mechanism works.

For example, the user inputs `select 1 y/2018 m/06` to select the 1st person in the address book and view his/her event schedule on June 2018.

* The command text is passed to an instance of the `LogicManager` class.

* The `LogicManager` instance calls `ProManageParser#parsecommand`, which parses the `select` command phrase.

* `InviteCommandParser#parse` parses the person and date parameter(optional). Depending on whether the date parameter is inputted,  an instance of the `SelectCommand` encapsulating the relevant information is then returned.

* `Logic Manager` then executes this `SelectCommand` by calling `SelectCommand#execute`.

* The filtered person list is first obtained by calling `PersonModel#getFilteredPersonList`. Based on the index, the `Person` is selected. The `Person` object's email is obtained by calling `Person#getEmail`

* A `Predicate` will be constructed to generate the filtered event list.
** If the user chose to view all the events of the person (e.g. `select 1`), an `AttendeeContainsEmailPredicate` object will be instantiated.
** If the user chose to view the events of the person on a certain time period (e.g. `select 1 y/2018 m/12`), an `EventContainsAttendeeAndDatePredicate` object will be instantiated.

* The filtered event list is then updated by calling `Model#updateFilteredEventList` with the predicate.

* The filtered event list is then sorted by calling `Model#sortByDate`.

* The `SelectCommand#execute` finally returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the execution of the `invite` command.

image::SelectSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

// end::Select[]

// tag::FindEvent[]
=== Find Event feature

==== Current Implementation
The `findEvent` allows the user to search for an event using some keywords. It searches for such events which contain at least
one of keywords in their names or description.


==== Execution of Command
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `findEvent` mechanism works.

Step 1. The user inputs `findEvent meeting` to find the event containing the word meeting in its name or description.

Step 2. The command is parsed and the result is shown.


// end::FindEvent[]

// tag::List[]
=== List Feature

==== Current Implementation

The `list` feature allows users to filter through all the individual people in ProManage and understand which department
they are from. The command currently has 4 sub-features; `list all` , `list all people`, `list all events` and `list dep DEPARTMENT`. The user can list all the
people and events in ProManage by simply typing `list all`. Alternatively, the user can filter through ProManage and get the
relevant Person's information by listing those of the specified department. The user can list multiple departments such
as `list dep Admin Finance`. As of now, each person can only be inside one department.

The listing of people from the respective departments is facilitated by the class: `Departments`,
a list of departments of type `String`.

The following is a more detailed description of the classes involved:

*  `Department`
** Each `Person` object has a `Department`, which is the department in which the person is in.
** This class is essentially another piece of information about the person.
** Each `Person` can only be in one `Department`.

==== Execution of Command

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism works.

Step 1. The user executes `list dep Admin` to list only the people in the Admin department. The command text is passed
to an instance of the `LogicManager` class.

Step 2. The `LogicManager` instance calls `ProManage#parsecommand`, which parses the `list` command prefix
"list".

Step 3. `ListCommandParser#parse` parses the type of command that is called upon and if applicable, the departments
listed. The list command can take in either `all`, `all people` , `all events` or `dep`. `all` means that are no predicates and 'dep' means specific
departments are about to be listed. An instance of the `ListCommand` encapsulating the type of `ListCommand` and if
applicable, the predicates involved, is then returned to `Logic Manager`.

Step 4. `Logic Manager` then executes this `ListCommand` by calling `ListCommand#execute`.

Step 5. The filtered person list is first obtained by calling `PersonModel#updateFilteredPersonList`. Based on the departments, the list of `Person` are selected.

Step 9. The `ListCommand#execute` finally returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the execution of the `list` command.

image::ListSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Future Improvements

===== Listing people who stay in the same town

The current `list` command does not utilize the address of each person. Thus, to make data more easily accessible, ProManage can implement Google Maps API and mark out where each employee stays on the map.

* Utilize Google Maps API and store the map - `list map`

===== Listing people's birthdays

The current person has no date of birth attribute. Thus, a date of birth attribute could be implemented. On top of that, ProManage can display the current date and time. Along with this,
it can list out the upcoming birthdays of the personnel in the company.

* Implement date of birth attribute and display current date and time the moment the application is launched. List out upcoming birthdays - `list birthdays`
// end::List[]

// tag::UndoRedo[]
=== Undo/Redo Feature

==== Current Implementation

The `undo` and `redo` feature allows users to undo and redo their previous commands. The commands that can
be undone are only those that modify the contents of the address book or event list, such as adding a person
or event within the app. This is managed within `ModelManager`.

The undo/redo mechanism is implemented separately for the address book and event list by the
`VersionedAddressBook` and `VersionedEventList`. They are extensions of the superclass `AddressBook` and
`EventList` respectively with a history of states stored internally as an `addressBookStateList`
for the address book, `eventListStateList` for the event list, and a `currentStatePointer` in each of them.
To ensure that the address book and event list are undone/redone correctly, a `StateHistoryList` (sub-class
of `LinkedList`) is kept in the `ModelManager` to keep track of the list that was modified.

The following operations were implemented:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its internal history.

* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its internal history.

* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its internal history.

* `VersionedEventList#commit()` — Saves the current event list in its internal history.

* `VersionedEventList#undo()` — Restores the previous event list state from its internal history.

* `VersionedEventList#redo()` — Restores a previously undone event list state from its internal history.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` for the address book, and `Model#commitEventList()`, `Model#undoEventList()`
and `Model#redoEventList()` for the event list. Two wrapper methods, `Model#undo()` and `Model#redo()`
are also implemented. These will be the methods called by the commands `undo` and `redo`.

The `StateHistoryList` implements the following operations for the `Model` to decide whether to
undo/redo the address book or event list:

* `StateHistoryList#getCurrentState()` - Retrieves the latest record state.

* `StateHistoryList#getNextState()` - Retrieves the next (previously undone) record state.

* `StateHistoryList#decrementPointer()` - Shifts record state pointer back. Called during `undo`.

* `StateHistoryList#incrementPointer()` - Shifts record state pointer forward. Called during `redo`.

A command can either modify the address book, event list, or both. Within the model, the `StateHistoryList`
keeps track of all model methods which modify the address book or event list, and stores a history
record value within itself for each method called.

When undoing a command, the `ModelManager` requests for the latest record by `StateHistoryList#getCurrentState()`
and calls the corresponding `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` and/or `VersionedEventList#undo()`. The ModelManager
also informs the `StateHistoryList` that an undo command was issued to shift the pointer back.

When redoing a command,the `ModelManager` requests for the next record from `StateHistoryList` and
calls the corresponding `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` and/or `VersionedEventList#redo()`. The ModelManager
also informs the `StateHistoryList` that an undo command was issued to shift the pointer forward.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The VersionedAddressBook and VersionedEventList
will be initialized with the initial address book and event list states, and the currentStatePointers will
point to their single state respectively. The StateHistoryList is instantiated as an empty list.

image::UndoRedoModelInitializationStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `add` (with valid input arguments) to add a person to the address book. The `add` command calls
`Model#addPerson()`, which will add a state record index integer `STATE_ADDRESSBOOK` to the `StateHistoryList`.
This command is the last entered command, therefore the `pointer` in `StateHistoryList` shifts forward.
The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after
the `add` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the address book `currentStatePointer`
is shifted to the newly inserted address book state. The `currentStatePointer` for `VersionedEventList` remains unchanged
as only the `VersionedAddressBook` was modified..

image::UndoRedoNewCommandAB1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()` or `Model#commitEventList()`,
so the address book or event list state will not be saved into `addressBookStateList` or `eventListStateList`.
The `StateHistoryList` will also not save a record state.

Step 3. The user realises that they have accidentally added the wrong person, and decides to undo the action by
executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command calls `Model#undo()`, which gets the latest record state
from `StateHistoryList` and recognises that the `VersionedAddressBook` was modified in the previous command.
The `Model#undoAddressBook()` is then called, which shift the currentStatePointer once to the left, pointing it to
the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state. Also, the `pointer` in `StateHistoryList`
is shifted to the left by `StateHistoryList#decrementPointer`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommandAB2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous
address book states to restore. The undo command uses `Model#canUndo()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo. +

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 4.
The redo command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` in either
the `VersionedAddressBook` and/or `VersionedEventList` once to the right, pointing to the previously
undone state, and restores it to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `pointer` is at index `stateHistoryList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest memory state, then
there are no undone states to restore. The redo command uses `Model#canRedo()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

image::UndoRedoNewCommandAB3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 5.
The user then decides to add a new event to the event list, by the `addEvent` command. The `addEvent` command calls
`Model#addEvent()`, which will add a state record index integer `STATE_EVENTLIST` to the `StateHistoryList`.
This command is the last entered command, therefore the `pointer` in `StateHistoryList` shifts forward.
The `addEvent` command also calls `Model#commitEventList()`, causing the modified state of the event list after
the `addEvent` command executes to be saved in the `eventListStateList`, and the event list `currentStatePointer`
is shifted to the newly inserted address book state. The `currentStatePointer` for `VersionedAddressBook` remains unchanged
as only the `VersionedEventList` was modified.

image::UndoRedoNewCommandELStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6.
The user then decides to execute `clear`. Since this command must clear both the address book and event list,
the `clear` command calls both `Model#commitAddressBook()` and `Model#commitEventList()`. It adds a state
record index integer `STATE_BOTH` to the `StateHistoryList`. The `currentStatePointer` in both
`VersionedAddressBook` and `VersionedEventList` shifts to point to the newly added states respectively.

image::UndoRedoNewCommandBothStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Future Improvements

===== Façade Class for VersionedAddressBook and VersionedEventList

To improve abstraction and shift the responsibility of deciding which list to undo or redo away from the
`Model`, a façade class can be created, e.g. `VersionedProManage`, to hold the `StateHistoryList`,
`VersionedAddressBook` and `VersionedEventList`. The model will then only have to call the `VersionedProManage#undo()`
or `VersionedProManage#redo()` methods.
// end::UndoRedo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

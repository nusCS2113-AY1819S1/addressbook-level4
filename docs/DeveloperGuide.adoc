== Introduction

_BookInventory_ is catered solely for students as well as other managerial roles such as store managers and accountant. _BookInventory_ allows store managers to increase/decrease stocks for each book. Accountants will be able to check the total revenue and profits for individual books to make better decisions to improve the sales. Students will have access in checking the availability of materials related to their modules. Most importantly, _BookInventory_ is optimized for those who prefer to work with *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `BookInventoryChangedEvent` when the Book Inventory data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `BookListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `BookInventoryParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a book) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the `Book Inventory` data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Book>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Book Inventory`, which `Book` can reference. This would allow `Book Inventory` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Book` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `Book Inventory` data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedBookInventory`.
It extends `BookInventory` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `bookInventoryStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedBookInventory#commit()` -- Saves the current BookInventory state in its history.
* `VersionedBookInventory#undo()` -- Restores the previous BookInventory state from its history.
* `VersionedBookInventory#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone BookInventory state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitBookInventory()`, `Model#undoBookInventory()` and `Model#redoBookInventory()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookInventory` will be initialized with the initial BookInventory state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single BookInventory state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th book in the BookInventory. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitBookInventory()`, causing the modified state of the BookInventory after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `bookInventoryStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted BookInventory state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new book. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitBookInventory()`, causing another modified BookInventory state to be saved into the `bookInventoryStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitBookInventory()`, so the BookInventory state will not be saved into the `bookInventoryStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the book was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoBookInventory()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous BookInventory state, and restores the BookInventory to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial BookInventory state, then there are no previous BookInventory states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoBookInventory()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoBookInventory()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the BookInventory to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `bookInventoryStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest BookInventory state, then there are no undone BookInventory states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoBookInventory()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the BookInventory, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitBookInventory()`, `Model#undoBookInventory()` or `Model#redoBookInventory()`. Thus, the `BookInventoryStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitBookInventory()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `BookInventoryStateList`, all BookInventory states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire BookInventory.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the book being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of BookInventory states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedBookInventory`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::checkcommand[]
=== Check feature
One of the *important* features for BookInventory is for users, especially store owners, to be able to check the remaining stocks of the books in the inventory.
To do so, we have added a `check` command to the existing list of commands.

==== Current Implementation
The implementation of this command utilises both `Model` and `Logic` component to fulfil its function.

The following sequence diagram shows how the check command operation is implemented:

.Sequence Diagram for Check Command
image::CheckSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How check executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorts the entire BookInventory.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Unable to retrieve the original order of the BookInventory.
* **Alternative 2:** Only the displayed list is sorted.
** Pros: Original order of the BookInventory is kept.
** Cons: Changes in the original code to display the list is required.
// end::checkcommand[]

// tag::stockcommand[]
=== Stock feature
==== Current Implementation
The sell command utilises both the `Model` and `Logic` component to fulfil its function.

The stock operation is similar to the sell operation, refer to sell command for sequence diagram.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How stock command is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Increases quantity in the Quantity Class.
** Pros: Code is more cohesive.
** Cons: Adds more code to Quantity Class.
* **Alternative 2:** Replace quantity in the Book Class.
** Pros: Does not need to edit Quantity Class.
** Cons: Code becomes less cohesive.
// end::stockcommand[]

// tag::sellcommand[]
=== Sell feature
Since selling of books is the bread and butter of the store owners, we have added a `sell` command to the existing list of commands.

==== Current Implementation
The sell command utilises both the `Model` and `Logic` component to fulfil its function.

The following sequence diagrams show how the sell operation is implemented:

.Sequence Diagram for Sell Command
image::SellSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Sequence Diagram Reference for Sell Command
image::SellSequenceDiagramSd.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How sell command is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Determines if user input `Isbn` or `Index` in `SellCommandParser`.
** Pros: Increases the cohesion of the `SellCommand`.
** Cons: Construction of commands that accepts `Isbn` or `Index` differs from the other commands. Thus, we must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
* **Alternative 2:** Determines if user input `Isbn` or `Index` in `SellCommand`.
** Pros: Does not require changes to the code for construction of `SellCommand`.
** Cons: Decreases the cohesion of `SellCommand`.
// end::sellcommand[]

// tag::Request[]
=== Request feature
==== Current implementation
The `Request` command utilises both the `RequestModel` and `Logic` component to fulfil its function.
This is accessible for all users.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Request command is implemented in a different category
As mentioned above, `Request` is called in `RequestModel` and `RequestStorage`.
A request object consists of three objects, `Isbn`, `Email`, and `Quantity`.

===== RequestModel component

.Structure of the `RequestModel` Component
image::RequestModelClassDiagram.jpg[width="800"]

The implementation is similar to 2.4. Model component.
Note that `XmlAdaptedTag` class is removed as request has no tags.

===== RequestStorage component

.Structure of the `RequestStorage` Component
image::RequestStorageClassDiagram.jpg[width="800"]

Likewise, this implementation is similar to 2.5. Storage Component.

===== Aspect: How Request command is implemented

.Structure of `Request` (High Level Sequence Diagram)
image::HighLevelRequestSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

* **Similar to `Add` Command**
** After request command is called by the user, it gets parsed through a `RequestListParser`.
** The UI also prompts to `EventCenter` and shows that the `RequestList` has changed.
** `Request` object is created and added to the model.
** The storage then receives the request and returns message to model, which is then transferred to the UI.
** This notifies the user that the request is successfully submitted.

* **Similar to `Delete` Command**
** The bookstore owner may decide whether to accept or reject a request offer.
** After deciding, he or she can type `deleterequest` to remove `Request` from the `RequestList`.

===== Aspect: How ToggleRequests command functions

.Sequence Diagram of the `ToggleRequests` Component
image::ToggleRequestSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

** When the user types `togglerequests`, a `RequestPanelChangedEvent` exception is raised.
** A function in the UI page, `MainWindow`, handles this event by toggling the display.
** A message will then be sent to the user, indicating that the request panel is toggled.

// end::Request[]

// tag::statistic[]
=== Statistic feature
==== Current Implementation
The statistic feature is facilitated by a singleton class StatisticCenter. It is called directly from many existing commands and is stored in Json format.

[NOTE]
Currently this feature isn't integrated with the undo/redo feature. It is planned for v2.0.

The following sequence diagram shows how the StatisticCenter interact with sell command:

image::statisticSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How stock command is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Singleton Class
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Hard to test.
* **Alternative 2:** Dependency Injection.
** Pros: Decouples dependencies but hard to implement.
** Cons: Easier to test.
// end::statistic[]

// tag::passwordprotection[]
=== Password Protection
==== Current Implementation
A password is required by the user upon start-up of the application.

The password must be secured. A secured password must consist of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and other special characters. For example, “$%GA2dg#” is a good password.

image::password_activity_diagram.png[width="300"]

In order to prevent attackers from using easy brute force methods, the application will shut down after 3 consecutive tries.

The password will be generated from our team’s side and will only be passed to users discreetly, conveniently through the means of an email.

In this stage of development, the default passwords will be as follows:
.  Administrator: owner
.  Accountant: accountant
.  Student: password
*Format: [ROLE OF USER: PASSWORD]
The passwords can and are set by developers under CheckPassword.java.
The following sequence diagram shows how the password interacts with the user.

image::password_protection_diagram.png[width="800"]

After UiManager is created, it will automatically construct a MainWindow. The MainWindow will also create an instance of a CheckPassword window.
If password is valid, a role class will be created. Else, application will close after 3 wrong tries.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Required fields for password protection

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Use a password-only login UI.**
** Pros: It tricks attackers to think there is only a single password to enter the application.
Commands such as “add”, “edit”, “clear” etc will be unknown to the basic user i.e. students.
** Cons: Password is difficult to remember, users will spend the extra time to refer to his/her allocated passwords.
Passwords will be issued by us (the developer team) and must be secured.
* **Alternative 2: Use a username/password login interface.**
** Pros: Users can customize their usernames and passwords.
** Cons: Users can forget their passwords. Developers need to spend extra time to implement changing passwords for users. A user can create multiple account and can take up too much storage.
Difficult to handle sensitive data like passwords in plain text files, another implementation for encryption would be needed.

===== Aspect: Usable commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Populate usable commands into role after entering password.**
** Pros: : If attackers bypass the password UI, they will not be able to perform any commands. Commands are only enabled if the password entered matches the appropriate role.
** Cons: Doing so might cause the application to lag a little, if the command list is extensive.
Passwords will be issued by us (the developer team) and must be secured.
* **Alternative 2: Assign commands based on passwords. (Role class is omitted in this case)**
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: Poor readability in code. If the password UI is bypassed, attackers will be able to have access to commands.

// end::passwordprotection[]

// tag::commandpanel[]
=== Command List Panel UI
==== Current Implementation

A command list panel UI is made available for all user, to assist him/her better in the application.
It is a quick access panel located at the side of the application. The command list is sorted alphabetically.

This feature is geared towards beginner users.

image::command_panel.png[width="240"]

Selecting on any of the commands in the panel above, will show a brief message of the command in the result display.

In addition, the text in the command box will be replaced with a template of the command selected.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: UI design

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Use a table view (JavaFX).**
** Pros: All commands are displayed on-screen without having to click double.
** Cons: Takes up more space in the overall UI.
* **Alternative 2: Use a drop-down menu.**
** Pros: Slightly neater and aesthetically more pleasing.
** Cons: Not the most functional option, users must click twice and scroll through the menu.

===== Aspect: Selection Result

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Displays a message on-screen and replaces text in command box.**
** Pros: : Allow users (especially beginners) to edit the command field when given the template of the command. They will be guided via a message on-screen.
** Cons: Users need to spend the extra time clicking on and editing the command text provided instead of typing the command fluently.
* **Alternative 2: : Pops a new window indicating the required fields for command.**
** Pros: Highly sophisticated GUI handling.
** Cons: Application is meant for CLI for faster execution. Pressing on the wrong command may induce user frustration.

// end::commandpanel[]

// tag::commandprediction[]
=== Command Prediction

==== Rationale
To maximize user friendliness, we have implemented predictive text which will appear
familiar for phone users. *[yellow]#_BookInventory_#* users may inadvertently misspell command words,
e.g. lis (Expected command: list). This will now prompt a GUI log stating, "Did you mean,
list?" To achieve this, we have utilized the Dice Coefficient.

==== Current Implementation

.Logic Sequence Diagram (Command "Togglereq" called)
image::CommandPredictionSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Here is a step-by-step walk-through on how this algorithm works.

Step 1: When the user types "togglereq" in the command box and hits enter, the command is accepted by the UI
and passed to the `LogicManager`.

Step 2: It first gets the `previousCommand` keyed in by the user. This is necessary
as the commands undo/redo are only accepted in `RequestList` if the previous command keyed in
belongs to `RequestList`.

Step 3: `parseInput` is then called, which returns true as `DifferentiatingParser` detects that the command should
 belong to `RequestListParser`. `LogicManager` then calls `parseCommandRequest`.

Step 4: `RequestListParser` calls `performSimilarityCheck` in `SimilarityParser`. Dice Coefficient detects that the
command is similar to the command `togglerequests`, and return it in the form of a String, in `predictedCommand`.

Step 5: `ParseException` is eventually thrown in `RequestListParser`, signalling to the user that
a spelling error is detected.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How does Dice Coefficient works?

Dice's coefficient measures the similarity between two sets. In *[yellow]#_BookInventory_#*, we use it to help measure how
similar two strings are in terms of the number of common bigrams (A bigram is a pair of adjacent
letters in the string).The Coefficient result of 1 indicates identical vectors (completely equal strings) as
where a 0 equals orthogonal vectors (completely unequal strings).

Formula: Dice's coefficient = (2 * Common Terms) / (Number of terms in String1 + Number of terms in String2)

===== Aspect: How well does this algorithm predicts?

Our current implementation sets Dice's Coefficient to 0.5. For some scenarios, we have implemented
an adjusted value of 0.7. Through our testing, this appears fine for most spelling errors.
However, it will not predict too ridiculous errors because we do not wish to face a scenario where
the suggestion offers another command word which is unintended by the user.

// end::commandprediction[]

// tag::tabfeature[]
=== Tab feature
For users' *convenience*, we have implemented this feature to easily cycle through existing `ISBN` in the inventory without the need to manually type them out.

==== Current Implementation
The tab mechanism utilises `Ui`, `Model` and `Logic` components. It stores the list of Isbn in a Queue Data Structure.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the tab mechanism works

Step 1: The user enters `sell i/978` in the `CommandBox` to sell a book with the Isbn starting with '978'.

Step 2: The user now feels that keying the whole 13 digit of the Isbn is a hassle, and decides to complete the Isbn using pressing `tab`. The `tab` feature will take in `sell i/978` in the `CommandBox` and retrieve `978` from the Isbn field.

The following sequence diagram shows how the tab operation works:

.Sequence Diagram for Tab Operation
image::TabSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

After the function `navigateToNextIsbn()` is completed, `commandTextField.requestFocus()` and `commandTextField.positionCaret(commandTextField.getLength())` are called to bring the caret to the end of the line for users to continue typing the command.

Step 3: The user presses `tab` again as the Isbn is not correct. The `tab` feature will then check if the Isbn matches the first Isbn in the Queue. If it matches, the first Isbn in the Queue will be removed and added to the end of the Queue. The next Isbn in the Queue will be displayed.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How tab executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Accessing data in `BookInventory` using `Logic`.
** Pros: Does not change current imports of `CommandBox` for it to function.
** Cons: Increases coupling as it violates the Law of Demeter.
* **Alternative 2:** Accessing data in `BookInventory` directly in `CommandBox`.
** Pros: Easy to access.
** Cons: Increases coupling as `CommandBox` now imports both `Logic` and `Model`.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Book Inventory depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all books in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/logic/parser/BookInventoryParser.java[`BookInventoryParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/logic/parser/BookInventoryParser.java[`BookInventoryParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the BookInventory, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the BookInventory.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/BookInventory.java[`BookInventory`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/BookInventory.java[`BookInventory`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/book/Book.java[`Book`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/BookInventory.java[`BookInventory`] allows you to update a book, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/book/Book.java[`Book`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/BookInventory.java[`BookInventory`]. Loop through each book, and remove the `tag` from each book.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `BookInventory#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your BookInventory application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last book in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside book cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/BookCard.java[the `BookCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `BookCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

+
image::getting-started-ui-result-before.png[width="200"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/BookInventorySystemTest.java[`BookInventorySystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and BookInventorySystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

image::getting-started-ui-status-before.png[width="500"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the BookInventory is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of books when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleBookInventoryChangedEvent(BookInventoryChangedEvent)`] to update the number of books whenever there are new changes to the BookInventory.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/BookInventorySystemTest.java[`BookInventorySystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of books status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the BookInventory to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the BookInventory after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the BookInventory storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupBookInventory(ReadOnlyBookInventory)`, so that the BookInventory can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/storage/BookInventoryStorage.java[`BookInventoryStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/storage/XmlBookInventoryStorage.java[`XmlBookInventoryStorage`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `BookInventory`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a book specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first book to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first book.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/logic/parser/BookInventoryParser.java[`BookInventoryParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu.address/logic/parser/BookInventoryParserTest.java[`BookInventoryParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/logic/parser/BookInventoryParser.java[`BookInventoryParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu.address/logic/parser/BookInventoryParserTest.java[`BookInventoryParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `BookCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/BookCard.java[`BookCard`] s to display a remark for each book later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/BookListCard.fxml[`BookListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/BookCard.java[`BookCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/BookCardHandle.java[`BookCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/book/Quantity.java[`Quantity`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/book/Quantity.java[`Quantity`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Book` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/book/Book.java[`Book`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/book/Book.java[`Book`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the book will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `bookInventory.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedBook` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Book` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/storage/XmlAdaptedBook.java[`XmlAdaptedBook`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidBookBookInventory.xml`, `typicalBooksBookInventory.xml`, `validBookInventory.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `BookBuilder`
Since `Book` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu.address/testutil/BookBuilder.java[`BookBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/model/book/Book.java[`Book`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu.address/testutil/BookBuilder.java[`BookBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the book that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Book` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu.address/testutil/TypicalBooks.java[`TypicalBooks`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `BookCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/BookCard.java[`BookCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu.address/ui/BookCard.java[`BookCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Book` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu.address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysBook(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a book.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

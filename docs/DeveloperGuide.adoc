By: `Team T12-3`      Since: `Sep 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your itemal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

//tag::2.1[]
[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteItem.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `StockListChangedEvent` when the Stock List data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteItemEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
//end::2.1[]
// tag::2.2[]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts including `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ItemListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` component so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

// end::2.2[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `StockListParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a item) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteItemSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Stock List data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Item>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Stock List`, which `Item` can reference. This would allow `Stock List` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Item` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Stock List data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedStockList`.
It extends `StockList` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `stockListStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedStockList#commit()` -- Saves the current stock list state in its history.
* `VersionedStockList#undo()` -- Restores the previous stock list state from its history.
* `VersionedStockList#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone stock list state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitStockList()`, `Model#undoStockList()` and `Model#redoStockList()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedStockList` will be initialized with the initial stock list state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single stock list state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th item in the stock list. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitStockList()`, causing the modified state of the stock list after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `stockListStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted stock list state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new item. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitStockList()`, causing another modified stock list state to be saved into the `stockListStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitStockList()`, so the stock list state will not be saved into the `stockListStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the item was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoStockList()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous stock list state, and restores the stock list to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial stock list state, then there are no previous stock list states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoStockList()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoStockList()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the stock list to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `stockListStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest stock list state, then there are no undone stock list states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoStockList()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the stock list, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitStockList()`, `Model#undoStockList()` or `Model#redoStockList()`. Thus, the `stockListStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitStockList()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `stockListStateList`, all stock list states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire stock list.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the item being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of stock list states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedStockList`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::saveopen[]
=== Save/Open feature
==== Current Implementation

The save/open mechanism is facilitated by `SaveCommand` and `OpenCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the following operation:

* `Command#SaveCommand()` -- Saves the current version of the stock list as an XML file in a /versions/ folder.
* `Command#OpenCommand()` -- Opens the saved XML file as a table in the browser panel.

The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveStockList()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the saveCommand mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `save april_18` command to save the current version of the stock list as an xml file named `april_18.xml`.

Step 2. The `save` command calls `Model#saveStockList()`, which initiates a `saveStockListVersionEvent`. The `fileName` and `ReadOnlyStockList` are saved as public final variables in the event.

Step 3. The `handleSaveStockListVersionEvent` handler calls the `saveStockListVersion()` method from the `StorageManager` class.

The following sequence diagram shows how the save operation works:

image::SaveCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
.Figure 10. How save/open operation works

Step 4. The `ReadOnlyStockList` is saved as an xml file.

Step 5. The user executes `open april_18` command to open the saved april_18.xml file.

Step 6. The `open` command calls `Model#openStockList()`, which initiates a `openStockListVersionEvent`. The `fileName` is saved as a public final variable in the event.

Step 7. The `handleOpenStockListVersionEvent` handler calls the `loadFileAsPage()` method from the `BrowserPanel` class.

Step 8. The `loadFileAsPage()` method takes in the fileName and passes the directories of the `april_18.xml` and `template.xsl` files into `transformXml()` method.

Step 9. The `april_18.xml` file is transformed with the `template.xsl` stylesheet into a table format and is displayed by the browser engine on the browser panel.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How save executes

* **Alternative 1** (current choice) Save as .xml file.
** Pros: Able to display the inventory as a table by using XML transformation with XSLT. The .xml file can also be opened in Excel.
** Cons: -

* **Alternative 2** Save as .csv file.
** Pros: File can be imported or exported.
** Cons: Unable to style the displayed table in the application.

===== Aspect: How open executes

* **Alternative 1** (current choice) Transform .xml file into a table with a .xsl stylesheet.
** Pros: Able to display the inventory in a table format for ease of view.
** Cons: A template.xsl file must be included in the application.

* **Alternative 2** Open the .xml file as it is
** Pros: Does not require transforming the .xml file with XSLT.
** Cons: The displayed inventory is in XML format and hard to decipher.
// end::saveopen[]

// tag::statusfeature[]
=== Status feature
==== Current Implementation

The status feature is facilitated by the `Item` class, which contains the `Status` class.

* The status class keeps track of the quantities `Ready`, `OnLoan`, and `Faulty`.

The status feature is further facilitated by the 5 commands, `StatusCommand`, `ChangeStatusCommand`, `LoanListCommand`, `DeleteLoanListCommand` and `ViewLoansListCommand`. The commands extend `Command` and implements the following operations:

* `Command#StatusCommand()` - Lists out the items according to their status.
* `Command#ChangeStatusCommand()` - Changes the status from `Ready` to `Faulty`, or vice versa.
* `Command#LoanListCommand()` - Creates and stores a loan list and changes the item status from `Ready` to `OnLoan`.
* `Command#DeleteLoanListCommand()` - Deletes the loan list and changes the item status from `OnLoan` to `Ready`.
* `Command#ViewLoanListCommand()` - Lists out the loan lists.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command mechanisms behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `AddCommand` to add 50 Arduinos into the stock list.

* The `AddCommand` calls on the `Item Constructor` which creates the item object, and sets the status of all 50 Arduinos to `Ready` by default.

Step 2. The user executes the `ChangeStatusCommand` to change the status of 10 Arduinos from `Ready` to `Faulty`.

* The `ChangeStatusCommandParser#parseCommand()` is called and takes in the input string from the user, parses it into the `ChangeStatusDescriptor`, and returns a new `ChangeStatusCommand`.
* The `ChangeStatusDescriptor` class consists of the `itemName`, `quantity`, `originalStatus`, and `updatedStatus`.
* The `ChangeStatusCommand#execute()` is called. This calls the `Model#getFilteredItemList()` to obtain the item to update, and calls `Model#updateItem()` to update the item inside of the stock list with the new status.

The following sequence diagram shows how the changeStatus operation works:

image::ChangeStatus.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes the `StatusCommand` to list the items by status.

* The `StatusCommand#execute` is called. This calls the `Model#getFilteredItemList()` to obtain the item list.
* The `StatusCommand#sortSimpleItems()` iterates through the item list and sorts them according to the status.
* The sorted items are stored as `SimpleItem` objects, which stores the just `itemName` the and `quantity`, as these are the only 2 relevant fields.
* The results are shown to the user.

Step 4. The user executes the `LoanListCommand` to loan out 20 Arduinos to Davind.

* The `LoanListParser#parseCommand` is called and takes in the input string from the user, parses it into the `LoanerDescription`, and returns a new `LoanListCommand`.
* The `LoanerDescription` class consists of the `itemName`, `loanerName`, and `quantity`.
* The `LoanListCommand#execute()` is called. This creates a new `ChangeStatusCommand` and calls the `ChangeStatusCommand#execute()` to change the status from Ready to On_Loan.
* The `LoanListCommand#updateLoanList()` is called. This creates an `XmlAdaptedLoanerDescription` object and is added into the `XmlAdaptedLoanList`.
* The `LoanListCommand#updateXmlLoanListFile()` is called to save the changes in storage.

Step 5. The user executes the `ViewLoanListCommand` to view the loan list.

* The `XmlAdaptedLoanList#getLoanList()` is used to obtain the loan list
* The `ViewLoanListCommand#getMessageOutput()` iterates through the loan list and returns the result to the user.

Step 6. The user executes the `DeleteLoanListCommand` to delete the loan list when Davind returns the Arduinos.

* The `DeleteLoanListCommand#execute()` is called. This calls the `ChangeStatusCommand#execute()` to change the status from On_Loan to Ready.
* The `xmlAdaptedLoanList#getLoanList()` is called to obtain the loan list.
* The `ArrayList#remove()` is called to remove the loan list entry
* The `LoanListCommand#updateXmlLoanListFile()` is called to save the changes in storage.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How StatusCommand executes

* **Alternative 1:** Storing the items as an Item instead of SimpleItem.
** Pros: Easier to implement as I would not have to create a new class.
** Cons: This slows down the code, and it contains redundant information that is not required.
* **Alternative 2:** Iterate through the item list 3 times, one for each Status field.
** Pros: We would not have to create 3 ArrayList to store the items as they can be printed out immediately.
** Cons: This slows down the code significantly, and makes the code longer.

===== Aspect: How ChangeStatusCommand executes

* **Alternative 1:** Not creating a ChangeStatusDescriptor class to store the user inputs
** Pros: Easier to implement as I would not have to create a new class.
** Cons: This would make the code extremely messy as there would be multiple parameters to handle.

// end::statusfeature[]

// tag::login[]
=== Login feature
==== Current Implementation

The login mechanism is facilitated by `LoginCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the following operations:


* `LoginCommand#modifyLoginStatus()` -- checks if the password matches the account in the database, if it exists. If true, updates the logged in account status in `Model` accordingly.

* `LoginCommand#execute()` -- calls `LoginCommand#modifyLoginStatus()`. Then, checks login status in `Model` and displays a login success message if true and displays a failure message otherwise.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setLoggedInUser()` and `Model#getLoginStatus()` respectively.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the LoginCommand mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `login u/admin p/admin` command to log into StockList with *admin* and *admin* being the username and password credentials respectively.

Step 2. The `execute` command calls `Model#getLoginStatus()` and checks if the user is already logged in. If true, `execute` throws a `CommandException` notifying the user that he is already logged in.

Step 3. The `execute` command then calls `LoginCommand#modifyLoginStatus()`, which checks if the username *admin* exists in the account list, and if it does, checks if the given password *admin* matches the password associated with the username *admin*.

Step 4. If the *admin* password matches, `LoginCommand#modifyLoginStatus()` calls `Model#setLoggedInUser()` which updates the logged in account status in `model` with the logged in account set to *admin* and logged in status set to true.

Step 5. The `execute` command then checks the log in status via `Model#getLoginStatus()`. A success message is printed if true; otherwise a failure message is printed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the login operation works:

image::LoginSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How login executes

* **Alternative 1** (current choice) Check against various accounts stored in a file and allow access if match.
** Pros: Allows for multiple accounts with access to StockList.
** Cons: More memory usage.

* **Alternative 2** Checks against a single account that can be modified.
** Pros: Simple to implement, minimal memory usage, allows for only one access account.
** Cons: Does not allow access for multiple accounts, locked out of app if credentials lost.
// end::login[]

// tag::tag[]
=== Tag feature
==== Current Implementation

The Tag feature is facilitated by `TagCommand`.
It extends `Command` and implements the following operation:

* `TagCommand()` -- Finds and shows all items under specific tags.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `tag Lab1` command to list all items with the tag `Lab1`

Step 2. The `tag` command calls `updateFilteredItemListByTag()`, which shows the search result to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the tag operation works:

image::TagComponentSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How tagCommand executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** When multiple tags are used for search, the search result will be `all the items` contains at least one tag.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May be difficult for the user to tell which item contains one tag and which items contain the other tag.
* **Alternative 2:** Group the search result by different tags inputted.
** Pros: Will be useful in real-life scenario
** Cons: It is harder to implement and takes up more screen space to show the results.


// end::tag[]

// tag::addTag[]
=== AddTag/DeleteTag feature
==== Current Implementation

The AddTag and DeleteTag features are facilitated by `AddTagCommand` and `DeleteTagCommand`.
They extend `Command` and implement the following operations:

* `AddTagCommand()` --  Adds new tags to a selected item in the Stock List.
* `DeleteTagCommand()` -- Deletes some tags while keeping the rest of a selected item in the Stock List.

Given below are example usage scenarios and how the addTag/deleteTag mechanism behave at each step.

Scenario 1: `AddTag`

Step 1. The user executes `addTag 1 t/ Lab2` command to add a tag `Lab2` to the item with index 1 in the Stock List.

Step 2. The `addTag` command calls `updateFilteredItemList();` in `model` to show the stock list after the tag is added.

Scenario 2: `DeleteTag`

Step 1. The user executes `deleteTag 1 t/ Lab1` command to delete a tag `Lab1` from the item with index 1 in the Stock List.

Step 2. The `deleteTag` command calls `updateFilteredItemList();` in `model` to show the stock list after the tag is deleted.


==== Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Adds tags to or deletes tags from one item in the stock list.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May be complicated when the same tags need to be added to or deleted from multiple items.
* **Alternative 2:** Adds tags to or deletes tag from multiple items in the stock list.
** Pros: Will be more user friendly when same tags need to be added to or deleted from multiple items.
** Cons: It is harder to implement.


// end::addTag[]

//tag::lost&foundfeature[]
=== Lost and Found feature
==== Current Implementation
The Lost and Found mechanism is facilitated by `LostCommand`, `FoundCommand` and `LostandFoundCommand`. These three commands extend `Command`. And two class: LostDescriptor and Found Descriptor are created as well. The 3 commands implement the following operations:
* `LostCommand#lost()` -- Lost an item with its number from the Stock List.
* `FoundCommand#found()` --  Found a number of lost items from the Stock List.
* `LostandFoundCommand#lost&found()` -- List the lost items and the lost number.

Given below are example usage scenarios and how the Lost and Found mechanism behaves at each step.

Scenario 1：

Step 1. The user executes `lost 1 q/20` command to indicate 20 Arduinos are lost from the Stock List.

Step 2. The `LostDescriptor` consists of the lost quantity of the item.

Step 3. The `lost` command firstly calls `getFilteredItemList()` to get the item of the given index and its original quantity.

Step 4. Then `LostDescriptor` will be called and the lost quantity of the item will be returned.

Step 5. By using the original quantity of the item minus the lost quantity, the updated quantity of the item will be got.

Step 6. A copy is created and the change of the quantity is made to the copy. The copy then replaces the original item.

Step 7. The updated item list and success message is shown to the user. Updates are committed to the storage.

Scenario 2：

Step 1. The user executes `found 1 q/20` command to indicate 20 lost Arduinos from the Stock List are found.

Step 2. The `FoundDescriptor` consists of the found quantity of the item.

Step 3. The `found` command firstly calls `getFilteredItemList()` to get the item of the given index and its original quantity.

Step 4. Then `FoundDescriptor` will be called and the found quantity of the item will be returned.

Step 5. By using the original quantity of the item adds the found quantity, the updated quantity of the item will be got.

Step 6. A copy is created and the change of the quantity is made to the copy. The copy then replaces the original item.

Step 7. The updated item list and success message is shown to the user. Updates are committed to the storage.

Scenario 3:

Step 1. The user executes `lost 1 q/5` command to indicate 5 Arduinos are lost.

Step 2. The user executes `lost 2 q/3` command to indicate 3 Rasperry Pis are lost.

Step 3. The user executes `found 1 q/2` command to indicate 2 lost Arduinos are found.

Step 4. The user executes `lost&found`.

Step 5. The lost list will be shown to the user.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How Lost and Found executes


* **Alternative 1** (current choice) Create a lost&found list to record the lost&found history.
** Pros: Able to list all the lost&found records and history.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of usage and require more memory.

* **Alternative 2** When executing lost or found command, update the quantity of the item in the StockList.
** Pros: Easy to handle while only increasing and decreasing the quantity will be used and no need to record all the lost history.
** Cons: Unable to list all the lost and found history.
//end::lost&foundfeature[]
// end::lostcommand[],foundcommand[],lostandfoundcommand[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size


[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Data Encryption (Coming in V2.0)
In v2.0, app data will be encrypted using AES encryption for added security.

// end::dataencryption[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Stock List depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== Introduction

Event Manager is made for the residents of the Residential Colleges (RC) in the National University of Singapore (NUS). This application is build for those who prefer to use a desktop application for managing events and attendees. Moreover, the Event Manager offers a faster workflow *for those who prefer working with a Command Line Interface* while still retaining the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface. If you can type fast, you can work even faster with Event Manager to manage the various events in your RC! All you need is a laptop/computer to run this application. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all events
* **`add`**`n/Computer Science Workshop c/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com v/John street, block 123, #01-01 d/12/03/2018 15:30` : adds an event named `Computer Science Workshop` to the Event Manager.

****
* Edits the event at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed event list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

=== Locating events: `find`

Admin/User: Finds events whose field contains any of the given keywords specified by the user. +
Format: `find PREFIX/KEYWORD [MORE_PREFIX][MORE_KEYWORDS]` +

Available prefixes:

* k/ Default search option
* n/ Name search
* c/ Contact search
* e/ Email search
* p/ Phone search
* v/ Venue search
* d/ Datetime search
* t/ Tag search
* a/ Attendee search

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `sports` will match `Sports`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Sports Day` will match `Day Sports`.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Sport` will not match `Sports`.
* Events matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Sports Day` will return `Sports games`, `Good Day`.
* Command default prefix (k/) will allow searches in any field of an event, while other prefixes will result in events that must have that keyword in the indicated field.
* At least one of the available prefixes must be presented.
* When using different prefixes together, _logic AND operator_ is used. This means that if there is one or more prefixes in the combination that does not have any keywords following it, search results will always be empty.
****

[NOTE]
1. If there are more than 1 prefixes of the same type, for example, `find n/new n/dark n/meeting`, they will be automatically combined together, which means this command will be assumed to be the same as `find n/new dark meeting` +
2. If there is only the prefix without any keywords following it, no events will be found as there are no events with the required fields left empty +
3. Unknown prefixes will be ignored.

Examples:

* `find n/Day` +
Returns events with names `Sports Day` and `Any day`
* `find k/Sports Sci friends` +
Returns events having the name `Sports Competition`, venue `Sci Avenue`, and tag `friends`
* `find d/12/01/2018 04:30` +
Returns any event having date `12/01/2018` or time `04:30`

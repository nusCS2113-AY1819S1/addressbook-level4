== Introduction

_BookInventory_ is catered for students as well as other managerial roles such as store managers and accountant. _BookInventory_ allows store managers to increase/decrease stocks for each book. Accountants will be able to check the total revenue and profits for individual books to make better decisions to improve the sales. Students will have access in checking the availability of materials related to their modules. Most importantly, _BookInventory_ is optimized for those who prefer to work with *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*. Enjoy!

== Introduction

AddressBook Level 4 (AB4) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, AB4 is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB4 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list

=== Text prediction

The command box is able to do smart prediction on the current text in the box. +
This is similar to text prediction on shell programs and can be invoked by pressing the `Tab` key on the keyboard. +
If there are more than one prediction, the predictions will be listed in results window. +

For example, typing `c` in the box and pressing `Tab` will auto complete to the `clear` command. +
Typing `e` in the box and pressing `Tab` will list `edit` and `exit` in results window. +

In general, text prediction works on all commands. +
In particular, text prediction also works on the following attributes of a contact: +

* `name` (flag: `n/`) +

This feature is supported by the `find` command. When using `find`, first input the attribute's flag, followed by the argument, then pressing `Tab` will invoke this feature. +

For example in an address book consisting a contact with the name `Alex Yeoh`, typing `find n/ A` and pressing `Tab` will auto complete to `find n/ Alex Yeoh`. +
If no flags are given, be default, names are assumed to be predicted.

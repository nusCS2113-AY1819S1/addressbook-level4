== Introduction

Inventarie Pro is for self employed business owners who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing inventory*. More importantly, Inventarie Pro is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Inventarie Pro can get your inventory management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version 10 or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest inventarie.jar here (link will be added later).
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Inventarie Pro.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Once prompted, enter your username and password. This will be your permanent username and password for subsequent uses.

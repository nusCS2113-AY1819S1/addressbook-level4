== Introduction

Savee is a financial planner application for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their finances*. More
importantly, Savee is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). To enjoy the *full* benefits of the GUI of this app,
the best screen resolution to use would be `1920 x 1080 (1080p)` with the app in fullscreen. Other screen resolutions are also
supported, but the GUI display would be slightly different from the ones shown in the picture.
If you can type fast, Savee can get your finance management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Before users are able to use our software, he/she is required to do the following simple steps to set up other software
that is required.

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `Savee.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your copy of Savee.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all records
* **`add`**`n/Grocery shopping m/-70 d/20-9-2018 t/Shopping` : adds a contact named `Grocery shopping` to Savee.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd record shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[autocomplete]]
== Auto Complete Feature
// tag::autocomplete-a[]
This section describes the auto completing feature implemented on the input command box which
makes the typing interface of Savee more friendly and efficient.

A list of possible words will be displayed in a popup-box under the command box according
to the user input. Word suggestions are displayed when all letters of the current input word match the beginning of
the word in the suggestion word bank. e.g to suggest the word `expenditure` user can key in either `e`, `ex`, `exp`
and so on, which can all suggest the expected word. However, the expected word must exist in the appropriate word bank
which will be described in <<Features>>.

User may use the kbd:[&#x2191;] kbd:[&#x2193;] keys to navigate the list and select a word they wish to complete
their input with using kbd:[Enter]. If user does not wish to select a word for completion, user may press kbd:[ESC] or
kbd:[Space] or mouseclick anywhere else in the command box to move onto another word.
Auto completion is performed word by word and after completing a word, the typing caret will appear at the end
of the newly completed word. Previously existing text before and after the completed word will not be lost and will
be shifted accordingly.

When the suggestion window is not open, user may use kbd:[&#x2190;] and kbd:[&#x2192;] to navigate the text and
may go back to change previously entered texts. These texts will also allow autocompletion if possible, depending on the
command in use and parameters already entered.

[NOTE]

====
* While a list of suggestions is active, users may not perform some actions such as kbd:[&#x2190;] kbd:[&#x2192;] or
kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[A].
* Word suggestions are not case sensitive. e.g. `HEL` will have a possible suggestion `help`.
* Whitespaces will not affect the accuracy of the autocomplete.

** Typing `a` triggers suggestions of command words that begin with `a`.

[[Features]]
== Basic Features

This section describes the basic features essential to using Savee.

Input of the first few characters of a single word into an empty command box will suggest a list of
command words available in Savee that match the input word. Most features require additional input paramaters to
perform their unique functions.

Majority of our features come with their own auto-completion feature and will require the exact command word
to be entered as the first word in the input before the described completion for that command is enabled.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter
which can be used as `add n/Grocery shopping`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Grocery shopping t/friend` or as
`n/Grocery shopping`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME m/MONEYFLOW`, `m/MONEYFLOW n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

====
[[constraints]]
*Parameter Constraints*

* `NAME` can be any word, phrase or sentence.
* `MONEYFLOW` must be made up of only digits, a single "+" or "-" and at most one decimal point. Also, note that the maximum number of
digits the whole number part of this parameter can have is 12 digits.
* `DATE` is in the form of *dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year.
*dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while *yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.
* `DATE` entered must also be a valid date, no fake dates e.g. *60-11-2018*, *30-02-2018*. Leap years are also accounted for, meaning that you
can enter *29-2-2016* and it will still be accepted.
* `DATE` can be entered as `today` or `ytd` to conveniently input the local date today or yesterday.
* `TAG` is completely optional and can be any alphanumerical word, but limited to only 1 whole word, no whitespaces are allowed.
The maximum character length of the tag is 20 characters and the maximum allowed number of tags is 2 as these tags will be used to categorise each
record, to reduce effort on user's part in specifying another field.
* `TAG` is not case sensitive, all capital letters in tags are converted to lower case.
* `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`

====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Displays a help page with information on all commands in Savee.

Format: `help`

=== Adding a record: `add`

Adds a record of a financial activity to Savee with the given name, date, money earned or spent and tags. +
Format: `add n/NAME d/DATE m/MONEYFLOW [t/TAG]...` +

Name denotes the name of the financial activity, moneyflow denotes the money spent or gained in the financial activity
and date denotes the date the financial activity was completed. Each financial activity can be labelled with only 1
name, moneyflow and date and a maximum of 2 tags as these tags will be used to categorise each record to remove the need for user to specify another field.

[NOTE]
Moneyflow can be either a debit (expense) or a credit (income). +
To distinguish between an expense and an income, the user will need to enter a plus "+" or minus "-" sign before the
money amount. +
Only 1 record of the same name, same date and same moneyflow is allowed in the application. Duplicates of the same record is not
allowed unless it is of a different date, of a different moneyflow or of a different name.

Examples:

* `add n/Payment To John d/20-8-2018 m/-10`
* `add n/PaymentFromBetty t/friend m/+10 d/10-11-2018 t/classmate`

[[Add_Autocomplete]]
Auto-Completion: +
// tag::autocomplete-b[]

* Names
** Inputs starting with `n/` and words that come after it but before the next prefix `m/`, `d/` or `t/` use can be completed with names.
** Suggested words will be suggested based on words used in existing records' names e.g if an earlier
inserted record is named `Dinner with Family`, then `Dinner` `with` `Family` can all be possible suggestions.

* Dates
** Inputs starting with `d/` can be completed with dates.
** Dates must be entered as with the normal constraints and also have 2-digits for both day and months.
e.g to have a suggestion of `01-11-2018` to appear, you have to key in `d/` `0` for that date to appear.
`d/` `1/` will not work.
** Dates that are suggested will also only come from earlier saved records.
** Can also be completed to `today` or `ytd`.

* Moneyflow
** Does not offer auto completion.

* Tags
** Inputs starting with `t/` can be completed with tags.
** Tags will also only from from earlier saved records' tags and a pre-existing set of tags such as e.g.
food, travel, bills, shopping.

[NOTE]
* There is no autocompletion restriction on number of names, dates, moneyflow or tag inputs but command will still
require the appropriate number of parameters.

* Please note that the `undo` and `redo` command can only affect the Financial Planner but the not the Excel file created, meaning that when you enter `undo` command after you enter the `archive` command, the records archived will be added again back to the Financial Planner but the Excel file created will not be deleted.
* Please note that `undo` and `redo` command can only affect the Financial Planner but the not the Excel file created, meaning that when you enter `undo` command after you enter the `export` command, the Financial Planner will inform the user that *No more command to undo*, the records remain the same and the Excel file created will not be deleted.
* Please note that the `undo` and `redo` command can only affect the Financial Planner but the not the Excel file created, meaning that when you enter `undo` command after you enter the `import` command, the records imported will be deleted.

====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +

`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]

Format: `clear`

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

There is no need to save manually. In the event that the storage data cannot be read successfully due to parsing error,
the system would initiate Savee with a blank state.

[[morefeatures]]

// tag::summary[]
== Data Analysis Features

This section describe features for the user to analyse his/her financial status in greater detail.

=== Showing a summary table of all financial activity in a time period: `summary`

Shows a summary table listing by day, month or categories within a given time specified by the user. +
A `summary` is an item that contains information on the *date or month that is represented*, the *total expense calculated*, the *total income calculated* and
the *net money flow calculated.* A `category` refers to any `set of tags` that are assigned to any records in the application. +

The summary command supports both listing by date, by month and by categories. +
Format: +

* By Date: `summary date d/START_DATE END_DATE`
* By Month: `summary month d/START_MONTH END_MONTH`
* By Category: `summary category d/START_DATE END_DATE`

****
* Note that there are specific formats required for the dates and months entered.
* For the commands *"summary date"* and *"summary category"*, START_DATE/END_DATE must be in the format of
`dd-mm-yyyy` where `dd` represents day, `mm` represents month, `yyyy` represents year.
* For command *"summary month"*, START_MONTH/END_MONTH must in the format of `mmm-yyyy`, `mmm` represents the month with its three letter representations, and
`yyyy` represents the year in its numerical form.
* Refer to <<constraints>> for the more information on the parameters.
* Note that for mmm, it is case-insensitive, meaning both *"APR"* and *"apr"* are accepted.
****
// end::summary[]
Once the command has been executed, a panel will appear showing the summary table containing data that is relevant in the range. +
The table entries are sorted according to either date, month or category depending on the mode used in ascending order. +
At the same time, currently selected record will be unselected to reduce confusion for the user.

[NOTE]
The table listing is currently non-resizable. If either the date, month or category is too long, the default behaviour of this app is to truncate
those words and replace the parts truncated with ellipses("...").

// tag::summary[]
Examples:

* `summary date d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018`
* `summary month d/apr-2018 sep-2018`
* `summary month d/APR-2018 SeP-2018`
* `summary category d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018`
// end::summary[]
The screenshots below are examples of what you can see once the command has been accepted. The commands entered have been left
in for visualisation purposes. These screenshots are taken in *fullscreen mode*  at 1080p resolution.

Auto-Completion: +
// tag::autocomplete-i[]

* Mode Keyword
** First parameter after the `summary` keyword can be completed to `date`, `month` or `category`.

* Dates
** Input text can be completed to dates that already exist in records in Savee.
** Inputs starting with `d/` can be completed with dates as well as the argument that come immediately after the entire
`d/DATE` input as long as there are only whitespaces between them.
** Text can also be completed to `today` or `ytd`.

* Months
** Input text can be completed to months with year in the form e.g `nov-2018`.
** Suggestions are currently limited to inputs from `jan-2018` to `dec-2018`.

* There will be no suggestions on parameters that come after the fourth.
// end::autocomplete-i[]

// tag::stats[]
=== Showing a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories: `stats`

Shows a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories and displays these information in a pie chart. +
Format:`stats d/START_DATE END_DATE`

****
* START_DATE/END_DATE follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of
*dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year. *dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while
*yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.
* Refer to <<constraints>> for the more information on the parameters.
****

Once the command has been executed, 2 tabs will appear showing a pie chart containing data that is relevant in the range. +
At the same time, currently selected record will be unselected to reduce confusion for the user. If there are many categories shown and
the box is not large enough, you can use the scroll bar at the side of each legend to view the other categories which are not in view.


[NOTE]
Due to label constraints, some labels may not be displaying correctly if they are overlapping with other labels. This happens when the pie slice
is too small. To improve readability, we have decided to hide some labels in such scenarios. Also, when the label is too long, since the pie charts
need to fit the labels, the pie chart may become small as a result. To prevent such situations, please keep your labels short. This will be improved in
later versions of the product to remove the labels completely and use a mouse over input instead.
// end::stats[]
Examples:

* `stats d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018`

Below are some screenshots of what you can see when the command has been accepted. The commands entered have been left
in for visualisation purposes. These screenshots are taken in *fullscreen mode* at 1080p resolution.

// end::autocomplete-j[]
// tag::welcomepanel[]
=== Showing a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories of this month: `NO COMMAND REQUIRED TO BE TYPED`

Shows a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories using data of this month. +
No format is required for this feature as the feature is automatically triggered when there is any mutation of data within the application.
Another way of returning to the welcome panel from anywhere in the app is to press `HOME` on the keyboard or click `Home` on the menu.

This feature automatically tracks the *current date* and ensures that the data presented is updated regardless regardless of whether the application is *off* or *on for
prolonged periods of time*. This feature also works offline and retrieves information from the system clock to determine the current date. +

Even in the event where the user is using the application at close to 12 midnight of the last day of a particular month and the clocks strikes 12,
the application will update the data whenever it detects any record data modifications in the app to reflect the next month.

[NOTE]
The data used to represent the pie charts in the welcome panel is *only updated* whenever there are any changes to records within Savee. +
This includes adding records, deleting records and editing records in Savee, but not sorting, listing, summary, stats, etc.

Below shows a snapshot of what the user can see when there are records available of the current month. If the screen is too small, the welcome message may be
truncated to allow more space for the charts.

== Data management features:

This section describe features for the user to manage his/her records data in Savee, with the help of Excel.

// tag::exportexcel[]

=== Export the record data from Savee to the Excel file: `exportexcel`

Exports the records into an Excel file. +

There are 6 modes, default mode, single argument mode and dual argument mode (for Date) and single argument mode (Directory Path). +

Format: +

****
* *Default mode* `exportexcel` will list down all records in Savee and exports all of them to an Excel file and store the file in the default *Working Directory*, it will *detect automatically user's Working Directory*.

* *Single argument Date mode* `exportexcel d/DATE` will list down all records with the specified date and exports all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the default *Working Directory*, it will *detect automatically user's Working Directory*.

* *Dual argument Date mode* `exportexcel d/START_DATE END_DATE` will list down all records with the date that fall on either dates or between both dates and exports all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the default *Working Directory*, it will *detect automatically user's Working Directory*.

* *Single argument Directory Path mode* `exportexcel dir/DIRECTORY_PATH` will list down all records in Savee and exports all of them to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.

* *Single argument Date mode + Single argument Directory path mode* `exportexcel d/DATE dir/DIRECTORY_PATH` will list down all records with the specified date and exports all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.

* *Dual argument Date mode + Single argument Directory path mode* `exportexcel d/START_DATE END_DATE dir/DIRECTORY_PATH` will list down all records with the date that fall on either dates or between both dates and exports all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.
+
****

If the command is in *Dual argument Date mode*, START_DATE (the first `Date`) should be earlier than or equal to the END_DATE (the second `Date`). +
Date should follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of *dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year. *dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while *yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.

The Excel file name will be named based on the command, relating to Date: +

* *Default mode*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_ALL.xlsx`
* *Single argument Date mode*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_dd-mm-yyyy.xlsx`
* *Dual argument Date*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_dd-mm-yyyy_dd-mm-yyyy.xlsx`

If the Excel file with the same name and stored in same Directory exists, it will be overwritten. However, it *must* be closed before we enter the command.

After you enter the `exportexcel` command, you should *wait for few minutes* for the Excel file to be written.

Please note that `undo` and `redo` command can only affect Savee but the *not* the Excel file created, meaning that when you enter `undo` command after you enter the `export` command, the Savee will inform the user that *No more command to undo*, the records remain the same and the Excel file created will *not* be deleted.

Examples:

* `exportexcel`
* `exportexcel d/31-3-1999`
* `exportexcel dir/C:\`
* `exportexcel d/31-3-1999 31-03-2019`
* `exportexcel d/31-3-1999 dir/C:\`
* `exportexcel d/31-3-1999 31-3-2019 dir/C:\`


There will be two sheets in the Excel file, namely *RECORD DATA* and *SUMMARY DATA*.

* *RECORD DATA* stores all the data of record the user want to export, there are 4 columns: Name, date, money and tags, the tags names will be separated by ..., for visual benefit.

* *SUMMARY DATA* stored the summary statistics for the period you exported, and there is a *Line Chart* next to the table for visual statistic [refer to *Draw a line chart automatically inside the Excel sheet* part in *User guide* for more information].

* As the size of the Chart is fixed initially. Sometimes, when user exports too many dates, the distance between each date on the chart might be tight. It is suggesting that the user justify the size of the chart by himself/herself.

* Dates
** Input text can be completed to dates that already exist in records in Savee.
** Inputs starting with `d/` can be completed with dates as well as the argument that come immediately after the entire
`d/DATE` input as long as there are only whitespaces between them.
** Text can also be completed to `today` or `ytd`.
* Directory
** Does not offer auto-competion.

=== Import the record data from the Excel file to the Savee: `import`

There are 2 modes, single argument File Path mode and (single argument Directory Path + single argument File Name) mode +

Format: +


****
* *Single argument File Path mode* `import dir/FILE_PATH` will open the Excel file using the given File Path, import all records in Savee and check if these records exist in the Savee, then exports all of non-existent records to Savee.

* *Single argument File Path + single argument File name mode* `import dir/DIRECTORY_PATH  n/NAME_FILE` will open the Excel file using the given Directory path and given file name, import all records in Savee and check if these records exist in Savee, then exports all of non-existent records to Savee.

+
****

Examples:

* `import dir/C:\Financial_Planner_ALL.xlsx`
* `import dir/C:\ n/Financial_Planner_All.xlsx`
* `import dir/C:\ n/Financial_Planner_ALL`

Please note that User have to add the post-fix `.xlsx` at the end to indicate this is a Excel file (in first and second example).

The file user want to import *must* be closed before entering the command.

Please note that the `undo` and `redo` command can only affect the Savee but the *not* the Excel file created, meaning that when you enter `undo` command after you enter the `import` command, the records imported will be deleted.

When performing `import` command to import all the records data from the Excel file to Savee, user should take note that there are some constraints which may help the `import` command performs smoothly.

* The excel file can have multiple sheets, containing records data. The starting row of the table does *not* have to be first row of the sheet. This also applies to the column. There can be blank row blending in the table, but there must be *no* blank column.
* The First row of the table should have 4 cells, namely *NAME*, *DATE*, *MONEY*, *TAGS*. These 4 cells can be case-insensitive. The sheet with records data but does *not* have the first row, *NAME*, *DATE*, *MONEY*, *TAGS* will *not* be read. The information of *NAME*, *DATE*, *MONEY* columns should be fully filled, while the *TAGS* columns is optionally filled. Each tag should be separated by ... (*3 consecutive dots*). Beside ... , numbers and alphabet character, there should be no other character.

The picture below shows a good example for the Excel Sheet.

=== Archive the record data from Savee to the Excel file: `archive`

Archives the records into an Excel file. +

There are 6 modes, default mode, single argument mode and dual argument mode (for Date) and single argument mode (Directory Path). +

Format: +

****
* *Default mode* `archive` will list down all records in Savee and archives all of them to an Excel file and store the file in the default *Working Directory*, it will *detect automatically user's Working Directory*. Then, the records stored in the Excel file will be deleted automatically in Savee.

* *Single argument Date mode* `archive d/DATE` will list down all records with the specified date and archives all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the default *Working Directory*, it will *detect automatically user's Working Directory*.Then, the records stored in the Excel file will be deleted automatically in the Savee.

* *Dual argument Date mode* `archive d/START_DATE END_DATE` will list down all records with the date that fall on either dates or between both dates and archives all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the default *Working Directory*, it will *detect automatically user's Working Directory*.Then, the records stored in the Excel file will be deleted automatically in the Savee.

* *Single argument Directory Path mode* `archive dir/DIRECTORY_PATH` will list down all records in Savee and archives all of them to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.Then, the records stored in the Excel file will be deleted automatically in Savee.

+
****

If the command is in *Dual argument Date mode*, START_DATE (the first `Date`) should be earlier than or equal to the END_DATE (the second `Date`). +
Date follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of *dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year. *dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while
*yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.


The Excel file name will be named based on the command, relating to Date: +

* *Default mode*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_ALL.xlsx`
* *Single argument Date mode*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_dd-mm-yyyy.xlsx`
* *Dual argument Date*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_dd-mm-yyyy_dd-mm-yyyy.xlsx`
+

If the Excel file with the same name and stored in same Directory exists, it will be overwritten. However, it *must* be closed before we enter the command.

After you enter the `archive` command, you should *wait for few minutes* for the Excel file to be written.

Please note that the `undo` and `redo` command can only affect the Savee but the *not* the Excel file created, meaning that when you enter `undo` command after you enter the `archive` command, the records archived will be added again back to Savee but the Excel file created will *not* be deleted.

Examples:

* `archive`
* `archive d/31-3-1999`

== Spending Limit Features

* This section describes the limit feature that allows users to set values to control their future spending.
Constraints that apply to records also apply to each limit. Refer to <<constraints>> for more information.


[[addlimit]]
=== Adding a limit: `addlimit`

Adds a spending limit for a time period or a particular day to Savee. +
Format: `addlimit d/START_DATE END_DATE m/MONEYFLOW` (`limit d/DATE m/MONEYFLOW`)+

When inputting two days, START_DATE and END_DATE indicates the starting date and ending date for the limit.
If there is only one date, that day will be the time period.
MONEYFLOW denotes the money spending limit for that period of time.

* After the limits have been added, Savee will keep checking the latest condition of these limits.
Once the total amount of money spent during this time period exceeds the spending limit,
Savee will warn the user by sending the warning message.
****
* DATE_START must be earlier or equal than DATE_END. When DATE_START and DATE_END are the same, this will be equivalent to single DATE.
* Moneyflow for limit features can only be a positive integer, and does not require a "+" or "-".
* Any date or period of time can only have at most 1 assigned limit.
****

Example:

* `addlimit d/20-8-2018 m/100`
* `addlimit d/20-8-2018 30-8-2018 m/632`
* `addlimit d/20-8-2018 30-8-2018 m/100`

Format: `deleteLimit d/START_DATE END_DATE` (`deleteLimit d/START_DATE`) +

The deleting command is based on the date period, since there will be at most one limit
for one period of time, user only need to enter a period of time or a single date. The limit
with the same dates will be deleted. If there is no limit for that period, the program will
throw errors.
Delete
****

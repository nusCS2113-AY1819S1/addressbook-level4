== Introduction

Task Book is for students who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their daily tasks and ultimately, lead a more productive life. More importantly, AB is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB can get your management of tasks done faster than traditional paper notebooks or a mobile application. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

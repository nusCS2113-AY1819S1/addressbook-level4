== Introduction
Bank Address Book (BankAB) is a business process management and workflow application platform, whereby its users are all the employees in a banking environment.
This platform supports the basic daily routine of each employee such as:

*  Checking working schedule
*  Applying for leave application
*  Checking in and out during working hours

The managers and administrators will have higher priority access level of BankAB such as changing the
priority level of the employee and approve or reject leave requests. +
This user guide will give you step by step instruction on how you can use the features of BankAB.

==  Getting Started with BankAB
.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
    https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Download]
.  Create a folder named `BankAB` in the desired location.
.  Download the latest `BankAddressBook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here] into the folder `BankAB`.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  If the app does not contain any sample data (refer to <<List of sample user accounts at first launch or upon reset, Table 1>>), something went wrong during the download process. Delete the folder `BankAB` and repeat step 1 to 4.
.  The following table contains a sample list of employees with the respective account details when the application
runs for the first time or when ResetCommand was executed in the previous runtime:

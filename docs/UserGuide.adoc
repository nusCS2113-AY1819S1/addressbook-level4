== Introduction

FreeTime is a desktop app that allows you to *find free timeslots to meet team members for projects*. More specifically, it helps you identify the times during which everyone you want to meet is free. Timetable Deconflicter is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Each command has an alias (given in round brackets after the command word) that can be used to replace the full command word. e.g. `find John` is equivaluent to `f John`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

=== Security

The timetable content is locked, and it requires a user to either login with a preexisting account, or register a new one.

There are three commands that can be entered on this command line:

1. `login`
2. `register`
3. `ui`
4. `logout`
5. `exit`

.Login Page with Command Prompts

You will have to enter your credentials to log in. Only then would you be able to edit and view your own timetable,
and  view your friends' timetable. The timetable that belongs to people that are not your friends will not be available to you, till you
add them as friends.

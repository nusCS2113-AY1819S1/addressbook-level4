== Introduction

Student Planner (SP) is for a *one stop desktop app for students to manage their schedule*. More importantly, SP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, you can use SP for all your daily scheduling done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Introduction

Task Book is a desktop task manager application that is designed for students to manage their daily tasks and ultimately, lead a more productive life. More importantly, Task Book is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Task Book can get your management of tasks done faster than traditional paper notebooks or a mobile application. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `taskbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tasks for that day
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add t/TASK`, `TASK` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Do homework`.
//* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Address Book folder.

// tag::FAQ_milestone[]
*Q*: Why do I get this error when I tried to add milestones with a rank of "0" or "-1"?

image::FAQ_invalidRank.png[width="790"]

*A*: You can only enter *non-zero*, *positive* integers for rank!

*Q*: Why do I get this error when I tried to add a milestone?

image::FAQ_invalidIndex.png[width="790"]

*A*: You can only add milestones to *existing tasks*! In this case, there is only 1 task entered into the Task Book, hence attempting to add a milestone to index 2 of the Task Book will result in an error!

== Introduction

FinancialPlanner (FP) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their finances*. More
importantly, FP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FP can get your finance management
tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Before a user is able to use our software, he/she is required to do the following simple steps to set up other software
that is required.

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Financial Planner.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all records
* **`add`**`n/Grocery shoppings m/-70 d/20-9-2018 t/Shopping` : adds a contact named `Grocery shopping` to the Financial Planner.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd record shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Basic Features

This section describes the basic features essential to using our Financial Planner.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter
which can be used as `add n/Grocery shopping`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Grocery shopping t/friend` or as
`n/Grocery shopping`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME m/MONEYFLOW`, `m/MONEYFLOW n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

`dd-mm-yyyy` where `dd` represents day, `mm` represents month, `yyyy` represents year. All parameters should be specified in numerical form.
* For *summary by month*, START_MONTH/END_MONTH must in the format of `mmm-yyyy`, `mmm` represents the month with its three letter representations, and
`yyyy` represents the year in its numerical form.
* Note that for mmm, it is case-insensitive, meaning both *"APR"* and *"apr"* are accepted
****

Examples:

* `summary date d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018`
* `summary month d/apr-2018 sep-2018`

****
* START_DATE/END_DATE follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of
*dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year. *dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while
*yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.
****

Once the command has been executed, 2 tabs will appear showing a pie chart containing data that is relevant in the range. +
Note that due to label constraints, some labels may not be displaying correctly if they are overlapping with other labels. This happens when the pie slice
is too small. To improve readability, we have decided to hide some labels in such scenarios.

Examples:

* `stats d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018`

Below are some screenshots of what you can see when the command has been accepted.

image::UiPieChartExpense.png[width="790"]

* Dual argument mode: `export_excel d/START_DATE END_DATE`

****
* The default mode will list down all records in the Financial Planner and exports all the records in the Excel file. +
* The single argument mode will list down all records with the date equal to DATE specified in the format and exports all shown records in the Excel file. +
* The dual argument mode will list down all records with date equal to or later than START_DATE
and earlier than or equal to END_DATE and exports all shown records in the Excel file. +
****

Examples:

* `export_excel`
* `export_excel 31-3-1999`
* `export_excel 31-3-1999 31-03-2019`

== Spending Limit Feature

This section describes the limit feature that allows the user to set values to control their future spending.

=== Adding a limit: `limit` [Oscar]

Adds a spending limit for a time period to the FinancialPlanner. +
Format: `limit d/START_DATE END_DATE m/MONEYFLOW` +

START_DATE and END_DATE indicates the starting date and ending date for the limit.
MONEYFLOW denotes the money limit for that period of time.
The program will warn the user once the total amount of money spent during this time period exceeds the spending limit.
For each period of time, there is only one limit. If there is an overlapping time period which already has a limit set
, the program will throw error.
Once the limit has been set, the program will keep updating the latest information about
each limit.
****
* START_DATE/END_DATE follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of
*dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year. *dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while
*yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.
* MONEYFLOW refers to the limit on total money spent during a time period from START_DATE to END_DATE.
* MONEYFLOW should only conists of digits.
* Any date or period of time can only have at most 1 assigned limit.
****

Example:

* `limit d/20-8-2018 30-8-2018 m/100`

=== Deleting a limit: `deleteLimit` [Oscar]

Deletes a limit from the FinancialPlanner +
Format: `deleteLimit d/START_DATE END_DATE` +

The DATE_START and DATE_END are the two elements for limit searching. Since all the limits have
unique dates, once user input the two dates, the limit with same dates inside the
limit list will be deleted. If there is no limit sharing the same dates, it will throw error.

****
* START_DATE/END_DATE follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of
*dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year. *dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while
*yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.
****

Examples:

* `deleteLimit d/20-8-2018 30-8-2018`

=== Editing a limit: `editLimit` [Oscar]

Edit a limit to the FinancialPlanner +
Format: `editLimit d/DATE_START DATE_END m/MONEYFLOW` +

This command will edit an existing limit inside the limit list according to the
two dates. The newly input Money will replace the original money limit. If there is no limit
for that period of time, the program will return error.
****
* Typical format for a Limit MONEYFLOW parameter :"200"
** Typical example of *expense*: editLimit d/24-9-2018 25-9-2018 m/*200*
****

Examples:

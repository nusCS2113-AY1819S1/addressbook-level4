== Introduction

Something Daily (SD) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app to manage a significant number of academic tasks and keep track on expenditures*. More importantly, SD is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SD can get your tasks management and expenditure tracking done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`TDL add`**`t/Tutorial 5 m/CS2101 d/12-09 p/1` : adds a task named `Tutorial 5` to the To-do List.
* **`TDL delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd task in the To-do List
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Our product will be divided to two sub-parts which are called `To-do List` and `Expenditure Tracker`. For each part, do remember to add the domain command `TDL` (which represents To-do List) or `ET` (which represents Expenditure Tracker). E.g. in `ET check status`, `ET` is the domain command that leads you to Expenditure Tracker.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `TDL add t/TASK`, `TASK` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Homework`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g. `t/TASK [d/DATE]` can be used as `t/Homework d/12-09` or as `t/Homework`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `t/TASK m/MODULE`, `m/MODULE t/TASK` is also acceptable.

Format: `help`

=== Adding a task: `TDL add`

Adds a task to the to-do list +
Format: `TDL add t/TASK m/MODULE [d/DATE] [p/PRIORITY]`

****
* The format for `m/MODULE` tag is controlled by the list of modules availble in the application. Hence, only valid NUS module codes are allowed.
* The format for `d/DATE` tag must be `DD-MM`.
* The `p/PRIORITY` tag only accepts integer 1, 2 or 3, where `1` refers to highest importance and `3` refers to lowest importance.

=== Editing a task : `TDL edit`

Edits an existing task in the to-do list. +
Format: `TDL edit INDEX [t/TASK] [m/MODULE] [d/DATE] [p/PRIORITY]`

****
* Edits the task at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed uncompleted tasks list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* You can remove any task’s date or priority by typing `d/` or `p/` without specifying any fields after it.

Examples:

* `TDL edit 1 t/Tutorial 2 m/CS2113` +
Edits the task name and module code of the 1st task to be `Tutorial 2` and `CS2113` respectively.
* `TDL edit 2 t/Tutorial 2 d/ p/` +

****

Examples:

* `TDL sort by deadline` +
The tasks are now sorted by deadlines, where tasks without deadlines are at the bottom of the list.

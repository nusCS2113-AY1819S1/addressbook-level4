== Introduction

iHelp is *professional desktop application* for managing complex projects. More importantly, iHelp is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). iHelp can help you manage project scheduling effectively. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your iHelp App.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `DEPT, [MORE_DEPTS,]` can be used as `Dept1, Dept2` or as `Dept1`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[MORE_DEPTS,]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `Dept1`, `Dept1, Dept2` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME t/TIME`, `t/TIME n/NAME` is also acceptable.

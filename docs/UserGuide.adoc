== Introduction

Trajectory is a lightweight management system for those who need a no-frills solution for managing students, modules and classes. It is built for users who prefer typing (CLI) over GUI interaction. Tempted to make the jump? Head on over to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

=== Notes Management

==== Adding a note : `note add`
Adds a note to a module. +
Format: `note add m/MODULE_CODE [p/PRIORITY_LEVEL] [d/DATE]`

NOTE: `*The optional parameters PRIORITY_LEVEL and DATE will be available from v1.3*` +
- PRIORITY_LEVEL = { 1 = LOW, 2 = MEDIUM, 3 = HIGH } +
- If the PRIORITY_LEVEL is omitted, a default value of 1 (LOW) will be assigned to the created note. +
- The DATE parameter follows the `DD.MM.YYYY` formatting only.

****
* Upon entering the `note add` command, the system will prompt the user to type his/her note.
* The user can choose to cancel anytime during the note editing stage.
****

Example(s):

* `note add m/CS2113` +
This tells the system that the note is to be saved in the CS2113 module with a LOW priority and it has no date.
* `note add m/CS2113 p/2 d/31.12.2113` +

==== Listing all notes from a module : `note list`
Shows a list of all notes saved in the module. +
Format: `note list m/MODULE_CODE [P]`

NOTE: `*The optional parameter P will be available from v1.3*` +
- Adding the `P` parameter allows the user to view notes based on their assigned PRIORITY_LEVEL from highest to lowest. +
- It is not case-sensitive, hence the user can use either lowercase or uppercase. +
- If `P` is omitted, the list displayed is sorted by the order of creation.

Example(s):

* `note list m/CS1231` +
This will list all the existing notes from the CS1231 module in the order of their creation.
* `note list m/CS1231 p` +
This is similar to the previous example, except that the system will display the list from highest to lowest PRIORITY_LEVEL.


{sp} +

==== Deleting a note : `note delete` `[Coming in v1.2]`
Deletes a specific note. +
Format: `note delete m/MODULE_CODE INDEX`

* The INDEX refers to the corresponding number of each note when `note list` command is used.

Example(s):

* `note list m/CS2040C` +
A list of all notes saved in CS2040C module is displayed. +
`note delete m/CS2040C 1` +
Deletes the note that corresponds to INDEX=1 in the list.

==== Editing a note : `note edit` `[Coming in v1.3]`
Edits an existing note. +
Format: `note edit m/MODULE_CODE INDEX [p/PRIORITY_LEVEL] [d/DATE]`

* Edits the note with the specified INDEX.
* The INDEX refers to the corresponding number of each note when `note list` command is used.
* Upon entering the `note edit` command, the system will prompt the user to type his/her modifications to the note.
* The user can choose to cancel anytime during the note editing stage.

Example(s):

* `note list m/CS1010` +
A list of all notes saved in CS1010 module is displayed. +
`note edit m/CS1010 3 d/10.10.2019` +
The user will now be able to edit the note that corresponds to INDEX=3 in the list. The modified note will be saved with its assigned DATE changed to 10/10/2019 while its PRIORITY_LEVEL remains unchanged.

{sp} +

==== Finding a note : `note find` `[Coming in v1.2]`
Search and display existing notes from a module using keywords. +
Format: `note find m/MODULE_CODE k/KEYWORD [k/KEYWORD]..`

* Multiple keywords can be accepted.
* A minimum of one keyword is required for the command to work.

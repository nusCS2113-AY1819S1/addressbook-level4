== Introduction

JitHub is for students who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts, email, and calendar*. More importantly,
JitHub is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, JitHub can get your daily tasks such as checking schedule done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `jithub.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your JitHub.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* or *`h`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app
* *`h`* : access the help document

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

// tag::suggestions[]
=== Getting Smart Suggestions

Receive smart suggestions while typing in your commands. Press the `TAB` key while typing a command halfway to get
suggestions on possible commands without having to navigate to the help window. If only one command is available,
pressing `TAB` will auto-complete the command for you without the need to type it in manually.

This is particularly helpful when you are new to the commands and require time to get used to it. Pressing `TAB` would
show all helpful and useful information needed, and this would definitely benefit you as the learning curve to using our
application would not be steep.

Examples:

* While typing `his` to get `history` command, press `TAB`. The `history` command will automatically be filled in for
you as it is the only suggestion available. The command parameters would then be shown as a prompt to help you with your
input.
* While typing `e`, press `TAB`. The system will suggest to you all possible commands that start with `e`, which would
be `exportall`, `export`, `exit`, and `edit`.

=== Getting Wrong Command Suggestions

Should you type in a wrong command, fear not, as our system will automatically suggest to you what you have typed wrongly,
by giving you a closest approximation of word through the message box after you press enter.

The input is not case sensitive when looking for suggestions, hence it would increase the chance of getting a closer approximation of your
desired command!

This is particularly useful when you are typing very quickly, as sometimes you might make minor mistakes which can be
easily correctable from our application.

Examples:

* If you wanted to type `select` but you typed `salect` instead, the system will tell you that it is an invalid command,
and would suggest to you the command `select` instead.
// end::suggestions[]

// tag::calendar[]
=== Monthly Calendar View

Once you start running the application and select a person from the person list panel, the calendar of the current month will be displayed on the calendar panel.

The following diagram shows how the calendar looks like for November 2018.

// end::calendar[]

// tag::calendarViewSchedule[]

Command type: `select INDEX`

When matching schedules, the common time slots found are to be displayed on the calendar panel.
Command type: `matchSchedule d/SELECTED-DATE st/START-TIME et/END-TIME i/INDEX-OF-PERSON...[INDEX]`
// end::calendarViewSchedule[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Encryption [Coming in V2.0]

When exporting contacts for the purpose of information transfer to another computer, encryption can be enabled before
the export command to prevent data misuse.

Command type: `encrypt for export`
// end::dataencryption[]

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the
data of your previous JitHub folder.

*Q*: How do I export my contacts to my phone? +
*A*: Use the `exportall` command to generate a csv file and transfer that file to your phone. Use your phone contacts
app to import that file.

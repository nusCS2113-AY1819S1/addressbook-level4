== Introduction

iHelp is *professional desktop application* for managing complex projects. More importantly, iHelp is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). iHelp can help you manage project scheduling effectively. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your iHelp App.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
